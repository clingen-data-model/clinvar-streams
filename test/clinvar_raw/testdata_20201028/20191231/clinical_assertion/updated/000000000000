Poloschek et al. (2010) reported that V2050L heterozygous carriers show centrally reduced mfERG amplitudes and additional minor fundus abnormalities, which suggested that the V2050L variant in the heterozygous state is capable of mildly reducing macular function without an additional pathogenic variant on the second allele. However, the V2050L variant is observed in 202/34420 (0.5869%) alleles from individuals of Latino background and 787/277174 (0.2839%) global alleles, with one homozygote reported (Lek et al., 2016). The V2050L variant is a conservative amino acid substitution, which occurs at a position that is conserved across species. In-silico analyses, including protein predictors and evolutionary conservation, support that this variant does not alter protein structure/function. We interpret V2050L as a variant of uncertain significance.\"}"],"interpretation_date_last_evaluated":"2018-11-07","variation_id":"7884","id":"SCV000511911","clinical_assertion_trait_set_id":"SCV000511911","submission_names":["SUB5098196"],"variation_archive_id":"VCV000007884","content":"{\"AttributeSet\":{\"Attribute\":{\"$\":\"GeneDx Variant Classification (06012015)\",\"@Type\":\"AssertionMethod\"},\"Citation\":{\"URL\":{\"$\":\"https://submit.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ft/byid/7oynscmk/mdi-5616_26957_genedx_interprules_final_061215.pdf\"}}}}","clinical_assertion_observation_ids":["SCV000511911.0"],"local_key":"GDX:874|Not Provided","assertion_type":"variation to disease","submitter_id":"26957","interpretation_description":"Uncertain significance","review_status":"criteria provided, single submitter","internal_id":"977225","trait_set_id":"9460","date_last_updated":"2019-12-17","submitted_assembly":"GRCh37"}
