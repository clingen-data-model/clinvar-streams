The thermolabile c.665C\u003eT in a homozygous state has been correlated with reduced enzyme activity and increased homocysteine (Frosst 1995). Recent publication of the American College of Medical Genetics stated that this variant, c.665C\u003eT; p.Ala222Val, in the heterozygous form is unlikely to be of clinical significance (Hickey 2013); however, a possible effect of this variant when paired with the pathogenic MTHFR variant, on the opposite chromosome cannot be excluded.

Using alternate nomenclature, this variant would be defined as BRCA1 565A\u003eC. This variant was observed in several individuals with breast cancer and in one individual with gastric cancer (Zhang 2012, Lu 2015, Zhong 2016, Wei 2018). Functional analysis of this variant showed no significant difference as compared to wild type in a homologous directed repair assay (Lu 2015). BRCA1 Glu149Ala was observed at an allele frequency of 0.06% (12/18870) in individuals of East Asian ancestry in large population cohorts (Lek 2016).

This variant has been reported in ClinVar (Variation ID# 48176) as of uncertain significance. It has been identified in 0.2% (193/125430) of European chromosomes by the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD, http://gnomad.broadinstitute.org; dbSNP rs139954767); however, this frequency is not high enough to rule out a pathogenic role.

The variant has also been reported in two brothers affected with cone-rod dystrophy in a compound heterozygous state with a frameshift variant on the second allele, and in a heterozygous state in one individual affected with macular dystrophy (Allikmets et al. 1997; Lewis et al. 1999; Corton et al. 2013; Schulz et al. 2017; Haer-Wigman et al. 2017). The variant failed to segregate with the disorder in one family affected with autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa and in one with autosomal dominant macular dystrophy (Wiszniewski et al. 2005; Poloschek et al. 2010). The p.Val2050Leu variant has also been found as a complex allele in cis with either a stop-gained variant or a missense variant in individuals affected with ABCA4-related disorders (Sciezynska et al. 2016; Schulz et al. 2017). The variant was found in a heterozygous state in one of 1528 control individuals and in one unaffected parent (Allikmets et al. 1997; Lewis et al. 1999; Corton et al. 2013; Sciezynska et al. 2016). This variant is reported at a frequency of 0.028846 in Puerto Ricans from Puerto Rico from the 1000 Genomes Project and in one homozygote in the European (non-Finnish) population of the Genome Aggregation Database. Poloschek et al. (2010) showed that, upon ophthalmic examination, heterozygous carriers of the p.Val2050Leu variant display centrally reduced mfERG amplitudes and additional minor fundus abnormalities, suggesting that the p.Val2050Leu variant is capable of mildly reducing macular function in the heterozygous state without an additional pathogenic variant on the second allele. Based on the collective evidence the p.Val2050Leu variant is classified as a variant of unknown significance but suspicious for pathogenicity for ABCA4-related disorders.
