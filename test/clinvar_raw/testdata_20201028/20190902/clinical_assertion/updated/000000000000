Using alternate nomenclature, this variant would be defined as BRCA1 565A\u003eC. This variant was observed in several individuals with breast cancer and in one individual with gastric cancer (Zhang 2012, Lu 2015, Zhong 2016, Wei 2018). Functional analysis of this variant showed no significant difference as compared to wild type in a homologous directed repair assay (Lu 2015). BRCA1 Glu149Ala was observed at an allele frequency of 0.06% (12/18870) in individuals of East Asian ancestry in large population cohorts (Lek 2016). This variant is located within a region that binds BRD7 (Harte 2010). Protein-based in silico analysis, which includes protein predictors and evolutionary conservation, predicts that this variant is probably damaging to protein structure and function, and splicing models are uninformative in their assessment as to whether or not the variant is damaging.

The variant has also been reported in two brothers affected with cone-rod dystrophy in a compound heterozygous state with a frameshift variant on the second allele, and in a heterozygous state in one individual affected with macular dystrophy (Allikmets et al. 1997; Lewis et al. 1999; Corton et al. 2013; Schulz et al. 2017; Haer-Wigman et al. 2017). The variant failed to segregate with the disorder in one family affected with autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa and in one with autosomal dominant macular dystrophy (Wiszniewski et al. 2005; Poloschek et al. 2010). The p.Val2050Leu variant has also been found as a complex allele in cis with either a stop-gained variant or a missense variant in individuals affected with ABCA4-related disorders (Sciezynska et al. 2016; Schulz et al. 2017). The variant was found in a heterozygous state in one of 1528 control individuals and in one unaffected parent (Allikmets et al. 1997; Lewis et al. 1999; Corton et al. 2013; Sciezynska et al. 2016). This variant is reported at a frequency of 0.028846 in Puerto Ricans from Puerto Rico from the 1000 Genomes Project and in one homozygote in the European (non-Finnish) population of the Genome Aggregation Database. Poloschek et al. (2010) showed that, upon ophthalmic examination, heterozygous carriers of the p.Val2050Leu variant display centrally reduced mfERG amplitudes and additional minor fundus abnormalities, suggesting that the p.Val2050Leu variant is capable of mildly reducing macular function in the heterozygous state without an additional pathogenic variant on the second allele. Based on the collective evidence the p.Val2050Leu variant is classified as a variant of unknown significance but suspicious for pathogenicity for ABCA4-related disorders. This variant was observed by ICSL as part of a predisposition screen in an ostensibly healthy population.\"}"]}
