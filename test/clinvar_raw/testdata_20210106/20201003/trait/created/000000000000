{"keywords":[],"name":"Familial prostate cancer","id":"7312","medgen_id":"C2931456","public_definition":"Prostate cancer is a common disease that affects men, usually in middle age or later. In this disorder, certain cells in the prostate become abnormal and multiply without control or order to form a tumor. The prostate is a gland that surrounds the male urethra and helps produce semen, the fluid that carries sperm.Early prostate cancer usually does not cause pain, and most affected men exhibit no noticeable symptoms. Men are often diagnosed as the result of health screenings, such as a blood test for a substance called prostate specific antigen (PSA) or a medical procedure called a digital rectal exam. As the tumor grows larger, signs and symptoms can include difficulty starting or stopping the flow of urine, a feeling of not being able to empty the bladder completely, blood in the urine or semen, or pain with ejaculation. However, these changes can also occur with many other genitourinary conditions. Having one or more of these symptoms does not necessarily mean that a man has prostate cancer.The severity and outcome of prostate cancer varies widely. Early-stage prostate cancer can usually be treated successfully, and some older men have prostate tumors that grow so slowly that they may never cause health problems during their lifetime, even without treatment. In other men, however, the cancer is much more aggressive; in these cases, prostate cancer can be life-threatening.Some cancerous tumors can invade surrounding tissue and spread to other parts of the body. Tumors that begin at one site and then spread to other areas of the body are called metastatic cancers. The signs and symptoms of metastatic cancer depend on where the disease has spread. If prostate cancer spreads, cancerous cells most often appear in the lymph nodes, bones, lungs, liver, or brain. Bone metastases of prostate cancer most often cause pain in the lower back, pelvis, or hips.A small percentage of all prostate cancers cluster in families. These hereditary cancers are associated with inherited gene mutations. Hereditary prostate cancers tend to develop earlier in life than non-inherited (sporadic) cases.","content":"{\"Citation\":{\"@Abbrev\":\"NSGC, 2004\",\"@Type\":\"practice guideline\",\"ID\":{\"$\":\"15604628\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"}}}","type":"Disease","attribute_content":[],"alternate_symbols":[],"xrefs":["{\"db\":\"Genetic Alliance\",\"id\":\"Familial+Prostate+Cancer/2768\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"prostate-cancer\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}"],"alternate_names":["Hereditary prostate cancer"]}

IGD is associated with a normal sense of smell (normosmic IGD) in approximately 40% of affected individuals and an impaired sense of smell (Kallmann syndrome) in approximately 60%. IGD can first become apparent in infancy, adolescence, or adulthood. Infant boys with congenital IGD often have micropenis and cryptorchidism. Adolescents and adults with IGD have clinical evidence of hypogonadism and incomplete sexual maturation on physical examination. Adult males with IGD tend to have prepubertal testicular volume (i.e., \u003c4 mL), absence of secondary sexual features (e.g., facial and axillary hair growth, deepening of the voice), decreased muscle mass, diminished libido, erectile dysfunction, and infertility. Adult females have little or no breast development and primary amenorrhea. Although skeletal maturation is delayed, the rate of linear growth is usually normal except for the absence of a distinct pubertal growth spurt.","content":"{\"Citation\":{\"@Abbrev\":\"GeneReviews\",\"@Type\":\"review\",\"ID\":[{\"$\":\"20301509\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"},{\"$\":\"NBK1334\",\"@Source\":\"BookShelf\"}]}}","type":"Disease","attribute_content":[],"alternate_symbols":[],"xrefs":["{\"db\":\"MONDO\",\"id\":\"MONDO:0013946\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"614880\",\"type\":\"MIM\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"478\"}","{\"db\":\"GeneReviews\",\"id\":\"NBK1334\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"614880\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"symbol\"}"],"symbol":"HH15","alternate_names":[]}
