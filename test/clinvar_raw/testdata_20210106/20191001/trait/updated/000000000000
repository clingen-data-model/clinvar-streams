{"public_definition":"16p11.2 duplication is a chromosomal change in which a small amount of genetic material within chromosome 16 is abnormally copied (duplicated). The duplication occurs near the middle of the chromosome at a location designated p11.2. This duplication can have a variety of effects. Common characteristics that occur in people with a 16p11.2 duplication include a low weight; a small head size (microcephaly); and developmental delay, especially in speech and language. Affected individuals also have an increased risk of behavioral problems. However, some people with the duplication have no identified physical or behavioral abnormalities.Developmental delay and intellectual disability can occur in people with a 16p11.2 duplication. Approximately one-third of children with this condition have delays in developing physical skills such as sitting, crawling, or walking. The average IQ of affected individuals is about 26 points lower than that of their parents without the duplication. About 80 percent of people with a 16p11.2 duplication have problems related to speech or language. Both expressive language skills (vocabulary and the production of speech) and receptive language skills (the ability to understand speech) can be affected.One of the most common behavioral problems associated with this chromosomal change is attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Autism spectrum disorder, which affect communication and social skills, is diagnosed in about one in five people with a 16p11.2 duplication. Affected individuals also have an increased risk of mental health problems, including schizophrenia, anxiety, and depression. Recurrent seizures are possible in this condition, although they do not occur in most affected individuals.Other abnormalities that can occur with a 16p11.2 duplication include malformations of the kidneys and urinary tract. However, there is no particular pattern of physical abnormalities that characterizes 16p11.2 duplications; signs and symptoms related to the chromosomal change vary even among affected members of the same family.","alternate_names":[],"attribute_content":[],"id":"9211","keywords":[],"medgen_id":"C3553407","name":"Chromosome 16p11.2 duplication syndrome","type":"Disease","alternate_symbols":[],"xrefs":["{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"614671\",\"type\":\"MIM\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"16p112-duplication\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}"]}

{"public_definition":"COL1A1/2 osteogenesis imperfecta (COL1A1/2-OI) is characterized by fractures with minimal or absent trauma, variable dentinogenesis imperfecta (DI), and, in adult years, hearing loss. The clinical features of COL1A1/2-OI represent a continuum ranging from perinatal lethality to individuals with severe skeletal deformities, mobility impairments, and very short stature to nearly asymptomatic individuals with a mild predisposition to fractures, normal dentition, normal stature, and normal life span. Fractures can occur in any bone but are most common in the extremities. DI is characterized by gray or brown teeth that may appear translucent, wear down, and break easily. COL1A1/2-OI has been classified into four types based on clinical presentation and radiographic findings. This classification system can be helpful in providing information about prognosis and management for a given individual. The four more common OI types are now referred to as follows: Classic non-deforming OI with blue sclerae (previously OI type I). Perinatally lethal OI (previously OI type II).

{"public_definition":"Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease encompasses a group of disorders called hereditary sensory and motor neuropathies that damage the peripheral nerves. Peripheral nerves connect the brain and spinal cord to muscles and to sensory cells that detect sensations such as touch, pain, heat, and sound. Damage to the peripheral nerves that worsens over time can result in alteration or loss of sensation and wasting (atrophy) of muscles in the feet, legs, and hands.Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease usually becomes apparent in adolescence or early adulthood, but onset may occur anytime from early childhood through late adulthood. Symptoms of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease vary in severity and age of onset even among members of the same family. Some people never realize they have the disorder because their symptoms are so mild, but most have a moderate amount of physical disability. A small percentage of people experience severe weakness or other problems which, in very rare cases, can be life-threatening. In most affected individuals, however, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease does not affect life expectancy.Typically, the earliest symptoms of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease result from muscle atrophy in the feet. Affected individuals may have foot abnormalities such as high arches (pes cavus), flat feet (pes planus), or curled toes (hammer toes). They often have difficulty flexing the foot or walking on the heel of the foot. These difficulties may cause a higher than normal step (steppage gait) and increase the risk of ankle injuries and tripping. As the disease worsens, muscles in the lower legs usually weaken, but leg and foot problems rarely require the use of a wheelchair.Affected individuals may also develop weakness in the hands, causing difficulty with daily activities such as writing, fastening buttons, and turning doorknobs. People with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease typically experience a decreased sensitivity to touch, heat, and cold in the feet and lower legs, but occasionally feel aching or burning sensations. In rare cases, affected individuals have loss of vision or gradual hearing loss that sometimes leads to deafness.There are several types of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, which are differentiated by their effects on nerve cells and patterns of inheritance. Type 1 (CMT1) is characterized by abnormalities in myelin, the fatty substance that covers nerve cells, protecting them and helping to transmit nerve impulses. These abnormalities slow the transmission of nerve impulses and can affect the health of the nerve fiber. Type 2 (CMT2) is characterized by abnormalities in the fiber, or axon, that extends from a nerve cell body to muscles or to sense organs. These abnormalities reduce the strength of the nerve impulse. In forms of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease classified as intermediate type, the nerve impulses are both slowed and reduced in strength, probably due to abnormalities in both myelin and axons. Type 4 (CMT4) is distinguished from the other types by its pattern of inheritance; it can affect either the axons or the myelin. Type X Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMTX) is caused by mutations in genes on the X chromosome, one of the two sex chromosomes. Within the various types of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, subtypes (such as CMT1A, CMT1B, CMT2A, CMT4A, and CMTX1) indicate different genetic causes.Sometimes other, historical names are used to refer to particular forms of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. For example, Roussy-Levy syndrome is a form of CMT11 with the additional feature of rhythmic shaking (tremors). Dejerine-Sottas syndrome is a term sometimes used to describe a severe, early childhood form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease; it is also sometimes called type 3 (CMT3). Depending on the specific gene that is altered, this severe, early-onset form of the disorder may also be classified as CMT1 or CMT4. CMTX5 is also known as Rosenberg-Chutorian syndrome.","alternate_names":["CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH DISEASE, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE, TYPE 4H","CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH DISEASE, DEMYELINATING, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE, TYPE 4H","Charcot-Marie-Tooth Neuropathy Type 4H"],"attribute_content":[],"symbol":"CMT4H","id":"786","keywords":[],"medgen_id":"C1836336","name":"Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, type 4H","type":"Disease","alternate_symbols":[],"xrefs":["{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"609311\",\"type\":\"MIM\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"99954\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"609311\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH DISEASE, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE, TYPE 4H\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"609311\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH DISEASE, DEMYELINATING, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE, TYPE 4H\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Alliance\",\"id\":\"Charcot-Marie-Tooth+disease%2C+type+4H/7962\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"charcot-marie-tooth-disease\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"609311\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"symbol\"}"],"content":"{\"Citation\":[{\"@Abbrev\":\"GeneReviews\",\"@Type\":\"review\",\"ID\":[{\"$\":\"20301641\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"},{\"$\":\"NBK1468\",\"@Source\":\"BookShelf\"}]},{\"@Abbrev\":\"GeneReviews\",\"@Type\":\"review\",\"ID\":[{\"$\":\"20301532\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"},{\"$\":\"NBK1358\",\"@Source\":\"BookShelf\"}]},{\"@Abbrev\":\"GeneReviews\",\"@Type\":\"review\",\"ID\":[{\"$\":\"23926620\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"},{\"$\":\"NBK153601\",\"@Source\":\"BookShelf\"}]}]}"}
{"public_definition":"Long QT syndrome (LQTS) is a cardiac electrophysiologic disorder, characterized by QT prolongation and T-wave abnormalities on the ECG that are associated with tachyarrhythmias, typically the ventricular tachycardia torsade de pointes (TdP). TdP is usually self-terminating, thus causing a syncopal event, the most common symptom in individuals with LQTS. Such cardiac events typically occur during exercise and emotional stress, less frequently during sleep, and usually without warning. In some instances, TdP degenerates to ventricular fibrillation and causes aborted cardiac arrest (if the individual is defibrillated) or sudden death. Approximately 50% of untreated individuals with a pathogenic variant in one of the genes associated with LQTS have symptoms, usually one to a few syncopal events. While cardiac events may occur from infancy through middle age, they are most common from the preteen years through the 20s. Some types of LQTS are associated with a phenotype extending beyond cardiac arrhythmia. In addition to the prolonged QT interval, associations include muscle weakness and facial dysmorphism in Andersen-Tawil syndrome (LQTS type 7); hand/foot, facial, and neurodevelopmental features in Timothy syndrome (LQTS type 8); and profound sensorineural hearing loss in Jervell and Lange-Nielson syndrome.","alternate_names":[],"attribute_content":[],"symbol":"RWS","id":"16707","keywords":[],"medgen_id":"C0035828","name":"Romano-Ward syndrome","type":"Disease","alternate_symbols":["LQT1","WRS"],"xrefs":["{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"101016\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000558497\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_symbols\",\"ref_field_element\":\"LQT1\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"192500\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_symbols\",\"ref_field_element\":\"WRS\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Alliance\",\"id\":\"6529\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Alliance\",\"id\":\"Romano-Ward+syndrome/9638\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"romano-ward-syndrome\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Office of Rare Diseases\",\"id\":\"3284\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"SNOMED CT\",\"id\":\"20852007\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"GeneReviews\",\"id\":\"NBK1129\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000501111\",\"ref_field\":\"symbol\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"192500\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"symbol\"}"],"content":"{\"Citation\":{\"@Abbrev\":\"GeneReviews\",\"@Type\":\"review\",\"ID\":[{\"$\":\"20301308\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"},{\"$\":\"NBK1129\",\"@Source\":\"BookShelf\"}]}}"}

This condition causes recurrent episodes of pain and joint swelling beginning in infancy or early childhood. These symptoms persist into adulthood, although they may improve for short periods. CRMO can lead to complications such as slow growth and the development of joint deformities called contractures, which restrict the movement of certain joints.Another feature of Majeed syndrome is a blood disorder called congenital dyserythropoietic anemia. This disorder is one of many types of anemia, all of which involve a shortage of red blood cells. Without enough of these cells, the blood cannot carry an adequate supply of oxygen to the body's tissues. The resulting symptoms can include tiredness (fatigue), weakness, pale skin, and shortness of breath. Complications of congenital dyserythropoietic anemia can range from mild to severe.Most people with Majeed syndrome also develop inflammatory disorders of the skin, most often a condition known as Sweet syndrome.

Of note, the GA-1 phenotype can vary widely between untreated family members with the same genotype, primarily as a function of the age at which the first acute encephalopathic crisis occurred: three months to six years in infantile-onset GA-1 and after age six years in later-onset GA-1. Characteristically these crises result in acute bilateral striatal injury and subsequent complex movement disorders. In the era of newborn screening (NBS), the prompt initiation of treatment of asymptomatic infants detected by NBS means that most individuals who would have developed manifestations of either infantile-onset or later-onset GA-1 remain asymptomatic; however, they may be at increased risk for other manifestations (e.g., renal disease) that are becoming apparent as the understanding of the natural history of treated GA-1 continues to evolve.","alternate_names":["GA I","Glutaricacidemia Type 1","Glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency"],"attribute_content":[],"symbol":"GA1","id":"2233","keywords":[],"medgen_id":"C0268595","name":"Glutaric aciduria, type 1","type":"Disease","alternate_symbols":["GA 1"],"xrefs":["{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"231670\",\"type\":\"MIM\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"25\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"231670\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"GA I\"}","{\"db\":\"SNOMED CT\",\"id\":\"360416003\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"Glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency\"}","{\"db\":\"Office of Rare Diseases\",\"id\":\"6522\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_symbols\",\"ref_field_element\":\"GA 1\"}","{\"db\":\"SNOMED CT\",\"id\":\"76175005\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_symbols\",\"ref_field_element\":\"GA 1\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Alliance\",\"id\":\"Glutaric+Acidemia+I/3110\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"SNOMED CT\",\"id\":\"76175005\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"GeneReviews\",\"id\":\"NBK546575\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"231670\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"symbol\"}"],"content":"{\"Citation\":{\"@Abbrev\":\"GeneReviews\",\"@Type\":\"review\",\"ID\":[{\"$\":\"31536184\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"},{\"$\":\"NBK546575\",\"@Source\":\"BookShelf\"}]}}"}

{"public_definition":"AP-4-associated hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP), also known as AP-4 deficiency syndrome, is a group of neurodegenerative disorders characterized by a progressive, complex spastic paraplegia with onset typically in infancy or early childhood. Early-onset hypotonia evolves into progressive lower-extremity spasticity. The majority of children become non-ambulatory and usually wheelchair bound. Over time spasticity progresses to involve the upper extremities, resulting in a spastic tetraplegia. Associated complications include dysphagia, contractures, foot deformities, dysregulation of bladder and bowel function, and a pseudobulbar affect. About 50% of affected individuals have seizures. Postnatal microcephaly (usually in the -2SD to -3SD range) is common. All have developmental delay. Speech development is significantly impaired and many affected individuals remain nonverbal. Intellectual disability in older children is usually moderate to severe.","alternate_names":["Cerebral palsy, spastic quadriplegic, 6"],"attribute_content":[],"symbol":"SPG52","id":"16108","keywords":[],"medgen_id":"C3279743","name":"Spastic paraplegia 52, autosomal recessive","type":"Disease","alternate_symbols":["CPSQ6"],"xrefs":["{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"614067\",\"type\":\"MIM\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"280763\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Alliance\",\"id\":\"Cerebral+palsy%2C+spastic+quadriplegic%2C+6/7945\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"Cerebral palsy, spastic quadriplegic, 6\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"614067\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_symbols\",\"ref_field_element\":\"CPSQ6\"}","{\"db\":\"GeneReviews\",\"id\":\"NBK535153\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"614067\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"symbol\"}"],"content":"{\"Citation\":[{\"@Abbrev\":\"AAN/CNS, 2004\",\"@Type\":\"practice guideline\",\"ID\":{\"$\":\"15037681\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"}},{\"@Abbrev\":\"GeneReviews\",\"@Type\":\"review\",\"ID\":[{\"$\":\"30543385\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"},{\"$\":\"NBK535153\",\"@Source\":\"BookShelf\"}]}]}"}

{"public_definition":"Von Willebrand disease (VWD), a congenital bleeding disorder caused by deficient or defective plasma von Willebrand factor (VWF), may only become apparent on hemostatic challenge, and bleeding history may become more apparent with increasing age. Recent guidelines on VWD have recommended taking a VWF level of 30 or 40 IU/dL as a cutoff for those diagnosed with the disorder. Individuals with VWF levels greater than 30 IU/dL and lower than 50 IU/dL can be described as having a risk factor for bleeding. This change in guidelines significantly alters the proportion of individuals with each disease type. Type 1 VWD (~30% of VWD) typically manifests as mild mucocutaneous bleeding. Type 2 VWD accounts for approximately 60% of VWD. Type 2 subtypes include: Type 2A, which usually manifests as mild-to-moderate mucocutaneous bleeding; Type 2B, which typically manifests as mild-to-moderate mucocutaneous bleeding that can include thrombocytopenia that worsens in certain circumstances; Type 2M, which typically manifests as mild-moderate mucocutaneous bleeding; Type 2N, which can manifest as excessive bleeding with surgery and mimics mild hemophilia A.

{"disease_mechanism":"gain of function","public_definition":"Breast cancer is a disease in which certain cells in the breast become abnormal and multiply uncontrollably to form a tumor. Although breast cancer is much more common in women, this form of cancer can also develop in men. In both women and men, the most common form of breast cancer begins in cells lining the milk ducts (ductal cancer). In women, cancer can also develop in the glands that produce milk (lobular cancer). Most men have little or no lobular tissue, so lobular cancer in men is very rare.In its early stages, breast cancer usually does not cause pain and may exhibit no noticeable symptoms. As the cancer progresses, signs and symptoms can include a lump or thickening in or near the breast; a change in the size or shape of the breast; nipple discharge, tenderness, or retraction (turning inward); and skin irritation, dimpling, or scaliness. However, these changes can occur as part of many different conditions. Having one or more of these symptoms does not mean that a person definitely has breast cancer.In some cases, cancerous tumors can invade surrounding tissue and spread to other parts of the body. If breast cancer spreads, cancerous cells most often appear in the bones, liver, lungs, or brain. Tumors that begin at one site and then spread to other areas of the body are called metastatic cancers.A small percentage of all breast cancers cluster in families. These cancers are described as hereditary and are associated with inherited gene mutations. Hereditary breast cancers tend to develop earlier in life than noninherited (sporadic) cases, and new (primary) tumors are more likely to develop in both breasts.","alternate_names":["Breast cancer","Breast tumor","Neoplasia of the breast","Neoplasm of breast","Tumours of the breast"],"attribute_content":[],"disease_mechanism_id":"274","id":"18285","keywords":[],"medgen_id":"C1458155","name":"Neoplasm of the breast","type":"Disease","alternate_symbols":[],"xrefs":["{\"db\":\"Human Phenotype Ontology\",\"id\":\"HP:0010623\",\"type\":\"secondary\"}","{\"db\":\"Human Phenotype Ontology\",\"id\":\"HP:0100013\",\"type\":\"primary\"}","{\"db\":\"MeSH\",\"id\":\"D001943\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"180250\"}","{\"db\":\"CSER_CC_NCGL;

Fractures can occur in any bone but are most common in the extremities. DI is characterized by gray or brown teeth that may appear translucent, wear down, and break easily. COL1A1/2-OI has been classified into four types based on clinical presentation and radiographic findings.

The classic form, occurring in males with less than 1% α-Gal A enzyme activity, usually has its onset in childhood or adolescence with periodic crises of severe pain in the extremities (acroparesthesia), the appearance of vascular cutaneous lesions (angiokeratomas), sweating abnormalities (anhidrosis, hypohidrosis, and rarely hyperhidrosis), characteristic corneal and lenticular opacities, and proteinuria. Gradual deterioration of renal function to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) usually occurs in men in the third to fifth decade. In middle age, most males successfully treated for ESRD develop cardiac and/or cerebrovascular disease, a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Heterozygous females typically have milder symptoms at a later age of onset than males. Rarely, they may be relatively asymptomatic throughout a normal life span or may have symptoms as severe as those observed in males with the classic phenotype. In contrast, males with greater than 1% α-Gal A activity may have: (1) a cardiac variant phenotype that usually presents in the sixth to eighth decade with left ventricular hypertrophy, cardiomyopathy and arrhythmia, and proteinuria, but without ESRD; or (2) a renal variant phenotype, associated with ESRD but without the skin lesions or pain; or (3) cerebrovascular disease presenting as stroke or transient ischemic attack.","alternate_names":["Angiokeratoma corporis diffusum","Fabry syndrome","Fabry's disease"],"attribute_content":["{\"Attribute\":{\"$\":\"loss of
