Individuals with the condition can develop signs and symptoms at any age, but it usually appears after adolescence.Signs and symptoms of systemic mastocytosis often include extreme tiredness (fatigue), skin redness and warmth (flushing), nausea, abdominal pain, bloating, diarrhea, the backflow of stomach acids into the esophagus (gastroesophageal reflux), nasal congestion, shortness of breath, low blood pressure (hypotension), lightheadedness, and headache. Some affected individuals have attention or memory problems, anxiety, or depression. Many individuals with systemic mastocytosis develop a skin condition called urticaria pigmentosa, which is characterized by raised patches of brownish skin that sting or itch with contact or changes in temperature. Nearly half of individuals with systemic mastocytosis will experience severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis).There are five subtypes of systemic mastocytosis, which are differentiated by their severity and the signs and symptoms. The mildest forms of systemic mastocytosis are the indolent and smoldering types. Individuals with these types tend to have only the general signs and symptoms of systemic mastocytosis described above. Individuals with smoldering mastocytosis may have more organs affected and more severe features than those with indolent mastocytosis. The indolent type is the most common type of systemic mastocytosis.The severe types include aggressive systemic mastocytosis, systemic mastocytosis with an associated hematologic neoplasm, and mast cell leukemia. These types are associated with a reduced life span, which varies among the types and affected individuals. In addition to the general signs and symptoms of systemic mastocytosis, these types typically involve impaired function of an organ, such as the liver, spleen, or lymph nodes. The organ dysfunction can result in an abnormal buildup of fluid in the abdominal cavity (ascites). Aggressive systemic mastocytosis is associated with a loss of bone tissue (osteoporosis and osteopenia) and multiple bone fractures. Systemic mastocytosis with an associated hematologic neoplasm and mast cell leukemia both involve blood cell disorders or blood cell cancer (leukemia). Mast cell leukemia is the rarest and most severe type of systemic mastocytosis.Individuals with the milder forms of the condition generally have a normal or near normal life expectancy, while those with the more severe forms typically survive months or a few years after diagnosis.","keywords":[],"alternate_names":[],"type":"Disease","xrefs":["{\"db\":\"MeSH\",\"id\":\"D034721\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"systemic-mastocytosis\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}"]}

People with this condition have frequent episodes of low blood sugar (hypoglycemia). In infants and young children, these episodes are characterized by a lack of energy (lethargy), irritability, or difficulty feeding. Repeated episodes of low blood sugar increase the risk for serious complications such as breathing difficulties, seizures, intellectual disability, vision loss, brain damage, and coma.The severity of congenital hyperinsulinism varies widely among affected individuals, even among members of the same family. About 60 percent of infants with this condition experience a hypoglycemic episode within the first month of life. Other affected children develop hypoglycemia by early childhood. Unlike typical episodes of hypoglycemia, which occur most often after periods without food (fasting) or after exercising, episodes of hypoglycemia in people with congenital hyperinsulinism can also occur after eating.","keywords":[],"content":"{\"Citation\":{\"@Abbrev\":\"GeneReviews\",\"@Type\":\"review\",\"ID\":[{\"$\":\"20301549\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"},{\"$\":\"NBK1375\",\"@Source\":\"BookShelf\"}]}}","alternate_names":["Exercise-induced hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia","Hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia familial 7"],"type":"Disease","xrefs":["{\"db\":\"MONDO\",\"id\":\"MONDO:0012396\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"610021\",\"type\":\"MIM\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"165991\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Alliance\",\"id\":\"Exercise-Induced+Hyperinsulinemic+Hypoglycemia/2669\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"Exercise-induced hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia\"}","{\"db\":\"Office of Rare Diseases\",\"id\":\"9932\",\"ref_field\":\"gard_id\"}","{\"db\":\"MONDO\",\"id\":\"MONDO:0012396\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"congenital-hyperinsulinism\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"610021\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"symbol\"}"]}

In infants and young children, these episodes are characterized by a lack of energy (lethargy), irritability, or difficulty feeding. Repeated episodes of low blood sugar increase the risk for serious complications such as breathing difficulties, seizures, intellectual disability, vision loss, brain damage, and coma.The severity of congenital hyperinsulinism varies widely among affected individuals, even among members of the same family. About 60 percent of infants with this condition experience a hypoglycemic episode within the first month of life. Other affected children develop hypoglycemia by early childhood.

Muscle weakness progresses to involve other limb and respiratory muscles. PDB involves focal areas of increased bone turnover that typically lead to spine and/or hip pain and localized enlargement and deformity of the long bones; pathologic fractures occur on occasion. Early stages of FTD are characterized by dysnomia, dyscalculia, comprehension deficits, and paraphasic errors, with minimal impairment of episodic memory; later stages are characterized by inability to speak, auditory comprehension deficits for even one-step commands, alexia, and agraphia.

While forms intermediate to these two extremes occur, all ASM deficiency that is not NPD-A is designated in this review as NPD-B, despite its wide range of manifestations and severity. The first symptom in NPD-A is hepatosplenomegaly, usually noted by age three months; over time the liver and spleen become massive. Psychomotor development progresses no further than the 12-month level, after which neurologic deterioration is relentless. A classic cherry-red spot of the macula of the retina, which may not be present in the first few months, is eventually present in all affected children. Interstitial lung disease caused by storage of sphingomyelin in pulmonary macrophages results in frequent respiratory infections and often respiratory failure. Most children succumb before the third year. NPD type B, later in onset and milder in manifestations than NPD type A, is characterized by hepatosplenomegaly with progressive hypersplenism and stable liver dysfunction, gradual deterioration in pulmonary function, osteopenia, and atherogenic lipid profile. Progressive and/or clinically significant neurologic manifestations occur infrequently.

In the era of newborn screening (NBS), the prompt initiation of treatment of asymptomatic infants detected by NBS means that most individuals who would have developed neonatal manifestations of MSUD remain asymptomatic with continued treatment compliance.","keywords":[],"content":"{\"Citation\":[{\"@Abbrev\":\"GeneReviews\",\"@Type\":\"review\",\"ID\":[{\"$\":\"20301495\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"},{\"$\":\"NBK1319\",\"@Source\":\"BookShelf\"}]},{\"@Abbrev\":\"GMDI/SERC, 2014\",\"@Type\":\"practice guideline\",\"ID\":{\"$\":\"24881969\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"}}]}","alternate_names":["Branched chain ketoaciduria","Branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase deficiency","Keto acid decarboxylase deficiency"],"disease_mechanism":"loss of function","type":"Disease","xrefs":["{\"db\":\"MONDO\",\"id\":\"MONDO:0009563\"}","{\"db\":\"MeSH\",\"id\":\"D008375\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"248600\",\"type\":\"MIM\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"PS248600\",\"type\":\"Phenotypic series\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"511\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000505096\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000505125\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000519087\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000521391\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000522317\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000522527\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000528448\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000528449\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000529111\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000561777\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000570054\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000591289\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Office of Rare Diseases\",\"id\":\"3228\",\"ref_field\":\"gard_id\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Alliance\",\"id\":\"Maple+syrup+urine+disease/4453\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"PS248600\",\"type\":\"Phenotypic series\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"511\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"SNOMED CT\",\"id\":\"27718001\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"GeneReviews\",\"id\":\"NBK1319\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"248600\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"symbol\"}"]}

This GeneReview focuses on: Classic galactosemia, which can result in life-threatening complications including feeding problems, failure to thrive, hepatocellular damage, bleeding, and E coli sepsis in untreated infants. If a lactose-restricted diet is provided during the first ten days of life, the neonatal signs usually quickly resolve and the complications of liver failure, sepsis, and neonatal death are prevented; however, despite adequate treatment from an early age, children with classic galactosemia remain at increased risk for developmental delays, speech problems (termed childhood apraxia of speech and dysarthria), and abnormalities of motor function. Almost all females with classic galactosemia manifest premature ovarian insufficiency (POI). Clinical variant galactosemia, which can result in life-threatening complications including feeding problems, failure to thrive, hepatocellular damage including cirrhosis, and bleeding in untreated infants. This is exemplified by the disease that occurs in African Americans and native Africans in South Africa. Persons with clinical variant galactosemia may be missed with newborn screening (NBS) as the hypergalactosemia is not as marked as in classic galactosemia and breath testing is normal. If a lactose-restricted diet is provided during the first ten days of life, the severe acute neonatal complications are usually prevented. African Americans with clinical variant galactosemia and adequate early treatment do not appear to be at risk for long-term complications including POI.","keywords":[],"content":"{\"Citation\":{\"@Abbrev\":\"GeneReviews\",\"@Type\":\"review\",\"ID\":[{\"$\":\"20301691\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"},{\"$\":\"NBK1518\",\"@Source\":\"BookShelf\"}]}}","alternate_names":["Galactose intolerance"],"disease_mechanism":"loss of function","type":"Disease","xrefs":["{\"db\":\"Human Phenotype Ontology\",\"id\":\"HP:0004919\",\"type\":\"primary\"}","{\"db\":\"MONDO\",\"id\":\"MONDO:0018116\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"352\"}","{\"db\":\"Human Phenotype Ontology\",\"id\":\"HP:0004919\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"Galactose intolerance\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000569081\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000591289\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Office of Rare Diseases\",\"id\":\"2424\",\"ref_field\":\"gard_id\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Alliance\",\"id\":\"Galactosemia/2973\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"SNOMED CT\",\"id\":\"190745006\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"GeneReviews\",\"id\":\"NBK1518\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}"]}

The hearing loss is classified as sensorineural, which means that it is caused by abnormalities of the inner ear. The loss of vision is caused by an eye disease called retinitis pigmentosa (RP), which affects the layer of light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye (the retina). Vision loss occurs as the light-sensing cells of the retina gradually deteriorate. Night vision loss begins first, followed by blind spots that develop in the side (peripheral) vision. Over time, these blind spots enlarge and merge to produce tunnel vision. In some cases, vision is further impaired by clouding of the lens of the eye (cataracts). However, many people with retinitis pigmentosa retain some central vision throughout their lives.Researchers have identified three major types of Usher syndrome, designated as types I, II, and III. These types are distinguished by the severity of hearing loss, the presence or absence of balance problems, and the age at which signs and symptoms appear. The types are further divided into subtypes based on their genetic cause.Most individuals with Usher syndrome type I are born with severe to profound hearing loss. Progressive vision loss caused by retinitis pigmentosa becomes apparent in childhood. This type of Usher syndrome also causes abnormalities of the vestibular system, which is the part of the inner ear that helps maintain the body's balance and orientation in space. As a result of the vestibular abnormalities, children with the condition have trouble with balance. They begin sitting independently and walking later than usual, and they may have difficulty riding a bicycle and playing certain sports.Usher syndrome type II is characterized by hearing loss from birth and progressive vision loss that begins in adolescence or adulthood. The hearing loss associated with this form of Usher syndrome ranges from mild to severe and mainly affects the ability to hear high-frequency sounds. For example, it is difficult for affected individuals to hear high, soft speech sounds, such as those of the letters d and t. The degree of hearing loss varies within and among families with this condition, and it may become more severe over time. Unlike the other forms of Usher syndrome, type II is not associated with vestibular abnormalities that cause difficulties with balance.People with Usher syndrome type III experience hearing loss and vision loss beginning somewhat later in life. Unlike the other forms of Usher syndrome, type III is usually associated with normal hearing at birth. Hearing loss typically begins during late childhood or adolescence, after the development of speech, and becomes more severe over time. By middle age, most affected individuals have profound hearing loss. Vision loss caused by retinitis pigmentosa also develops in late childhood or adolescence. Some people with Usher syndrome type III develop vestibular abnormalities that cause problems with balance.","keywords":[],"alternate_names":["Usher Syndromes","Usher's syndrome"],"disease_mechanism":"loss of function","type":"Disease","xrefs":["{\"db\":\"MONDO\",\"id\":\"MONDO:0019501\"}","{\"db\":\"MeSH\",\"id\":\"D052245\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"PS276900\",\"type\":\"Phenotypic series\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"886\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000561956\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000591289\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Office of Rare Diseases\",\"id\":\"7843\",\"ref_field\":\"gard_id\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"usher-syndrome\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"PS276900\",\"type\":\"Phenotypic series\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"886\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"usher-syndrome\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}"]}

While forms intermediate to these two extremes occur, all ASM deficiency that is not NPD-A is designated in this review as NPD-B, despite its wide range of manifestations and severity. The first symptom in NPD-A is hepatosplenomegaly, usually noted by age three months; over time the liver and spleen become massive. Psychomotor development progresses no further than the 12-month level, after which neurologic deterioration is relentless. A classic cherry-red spot of the macula of the retina, which may not be present in the first few months, is eventually present in all affected children. Interstitial lung disease caused by storage of sphingomyelin in pulmonary macrophages results in frequent respiratory infections and often respiratory failure. Most children succumb before the third year. NPD type B, later in onset and milder in manifestations than NPD type A, is characterized by hepatosplenomegaly with progressive hypersplenism and stable liver dysfunction, gradual deterioration in pulmonary function, osteopenia, and atherogenic lipid profile. Progressive and/or clinically significant neurologic manifestations occur infrequently.

The muscles most affected are those closest to the body (proximal muscles), specifically the muscles of the shoulders, upper arms, pelvic area, and thighs.The severity, age of onset, and features of limb-girdle muscle dystrophy vary among the many subtypes of this condition and may be inconsistent even within the same family. Signs and symptoms may first appear at any age and generally worsen with time, although in some cases they remain mild.In the early stages of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, affected individuals may have an unusual walking gait, such as waddling or walking on the balls of their feet, and may also have difficulty running. They may need to use their arms to press themselves up from a squatting position because of their weak thigh muscles. As the condition progresses, people with limb-girdle muscular dystrophy may eventually require wheelchair assistance.Muscle wasting may cause changes in posture or in the appearance of the shoulder, back, and arm. In particular, weak shoulder muscles tend to make the shoulder blades (scapulae) \"stick out\" from the back, a sign known as scapular winging. Affected individuals may also have an abnormally curved lower back (lordosis) or a spine that curves to the side (scoliosis). Some develop joint stiffness (contractures) that can restrict movement in their hips, knees, ankles, or elbows. Overgrowth (hypertrophy) of the calf muscles occurs in some people with limb-girdle muscular dystrophy.Weakening of the heart muscle (cardiomyopathy) occurs in some forms of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy. Some affected individuals experience mild to severe breathing problems related to the weakness of muscles needed for breathing.

It is most frequently used in combination with other drugs to treat advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer. However, irinotecan therapy is associated with a high incidence of toxicity, including severe neutropenia and diarrhea.\r\nIrinotecan is converted in the body to an active metabolite known as SN-38, which is then inactivated and detoxified by a UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzyme encoded by the UGT1A1 gene. The UGT enzymes are responsible for glucuronidation, a process that transforms lipophilic metabolites into water-soluble metabolites that can be excreted from the body.\r\nThe risk of irinotecan toxicity increases with genetic variants associated with reduced UGT enzyme activity, such as UGT1A1*28. The presence of this variant results in reduced excretion of irinotecan metabolites, which leads to increased active irinotecan metabolites in the blood. Approximately 10% of North Americans carry 2 copies of the UGT1A1*28 allele (homozygous, UGT1A1 *28/*28), and are more likely to develop neutropenia following irinotecan therapy.\r\nThe FDA-approved drug label for irinotecan states that “when administered as a single-agent, a reduction in the starting dose by at least one level of irinotecan hydrochloride injection should be considered for patients known to be homozygous for the UGT1A1*28 allele. However, the precise dose reduction in this patient population is not known and subsequent dose modifications should be considered based on individual patient tolerance to treatment”.\r\nThe Dutch Pharmacogenetics Working Group (DPWG) of the Royal Dutch Association for the Advancement of Pharmacy (KNMP) recommends starting with 70% of the standard dose for homozygous carriers of the UGT1A1*28 allele. If the patient tolerates this initial dose, the dose can be increased guided by the neutrophil count. They state that no action is needed for heterozygous carriers of the UGT1A1*28 allele (e.g., UGT1A1 *1/*28). In addition, the French National Network of Pharmacogenetics (RNPGx) has proposed a decision tree for guiding irinotecan prescribing based on the UGT1A1 genotype and irinotecan dose.","keywords":[],"content":"{\"Citation\":[{\"@Abbrev\":\"Medical Genetics Summaries\",\"@Type\":\"review\",\"ID\":{\"$\":\"NBK294473\",\"@Source\":\"BookShelf\"}},{\"@Abbrev\":\"NACB, 2010\",\"@Type\":\"practice guideline\",\"CitationText\":{\"$\":\"National Academy of Clinical Biochemistry, Clinical practice considerations.

Patients with specific variants in the gene CYP2C9 (the primary warfarin-metabolizing enzyme), such as CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3, may require a lower dose of warfarin as compared to patients without these variants.  Patients with a specific variant in VKORC1 (the target enzyme of warfarin), known as -1639G\u003eA or rs9923231, may require a lower warfarin dose as compared to patients who do not have this variant.

{"alternate_symbols":[],"id":"16461","medgen_id":"CN078013","attribute_content":[],"name":"Tamoxifen response","public_definition":"Tamoxifen (brand name Nolvadex) is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) that is commonly used in both the treatment and prevention of breast cancer. When taken for 5 years, tamoxifen almost halves the rate of breast cancer recurrence in individuals who have had surgery for estrogen-receptor–positive (ER+) breast cancer. Tamoxifen is the endocrine therapy of choice for treatment of premenopausal women with ER+ breast cancer, and an important alternative, or sequential treatment for postmenopausal women with ER+ breast cancer. In addition, tamoxifen is the only hormonal agent approved by the FDA for the prevention of premenopausal breast cancer in women who are at high risk, and the treatment of premenopausal invasive breast cancer and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). The CYP2D6 enzyme metabolizes a quarter of all prescribed drugs and is one of the main enzymes involved in converting tamoxifen into its major active metabolite, endoxifen. Genetic variation in the CYP2D6 gene may lead to increased (\"ultrarapid metabolizer\"), decreased (\"intermediate metabolizer\"), or absent (“poor metabolizer”) enzyme activity. Individuals who are intermediate or poor metabolizers may have reduced plasma concentrations of endoxifen and benefit less from tamoxifen therapy. At this time, the FDA-approved drug label for tamoxifen does not discuss genetic testing for CYP2D6. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Breast Cancer Panel does not recommend CYP2D6 testing as a tool to determine the optimal adjuvant endocrine strategy, and this recommendation is consistent with the 2010 update of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Guidelines (the most recent update, 2014, does not discuss pharmacogenetic testing). The Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) recently published updated guidelines for the dosing of tamoxifen based on CYP2D6 phenotype, with therapeutic recommendations for each metabolizer phenotype. For CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, CPIC recommends using an alternative hormonal therapy, such as an aromatase inhibitor for postmenopausal women; or an aromatase inhibitor along with ovarian function suppression in premenopausal women. This recommendation is based on these approaches being superior to tamoxifen regardless of CYP2D6 genotype, and the knowledge that CYP2D6 poor metabolizers who switched from tamoxifen to anastrozole do not have an increased risk of recurrence. The CPIC recommendation also states that higher dose tamoxifen (40 mg/day) can be considered if there are contraindications to aromatase inhibitor therapy; however, the increased endoxifen concentration among CYP2D6 poor metabolizers treated with a higher tamoxifen dose does not typically reach the level as in normal metabolizers. Recommendations from the Dutch Pharmacogenetics Working Group (DWPG) of the Royal Dutch Association for the Advancement of Pharmacy (KNMP) also discuss using an alternative drug to tamoxifen in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers.","keywords":[],"content":"{\"Citation\":[{\"@Abbrev\":\"PLoS Currents, 2010\",\"@Type\":\"general\",\"URL\":{\"$\":\"http://knol.google.com/k/issa-dahabreh/cyp2d6-testing-to-predict-response-to/3qgx0fg7r52v/1?collectionId=28qm4w0q65e4w.50#\"}},{\"@Abbrev\":\"ACMG, 2012\",\"@Type\":\"practice guideline\",\"ID\":{\"$\":\"22955113\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"}},{\"@Abbrev\":\"ASCO, 2010\",\"@Type\":\"practice guideline\",\"ID\":{\"$\":\"2936467\",\"@Source\":\"pmc\"}},{\"@Abbrev\":\"Medical Genetics Summaries\",\"@Type\":\"review\",\"ID\":{\"$\":\"NBK247013\",\"@Source\":\"BookShelf\"}},{\"@Abbrev\":\"NACB, 2010\",\"@Type\":\"practice guideline\",\"CitationText\":{\"$\":\"National Academy of Clinical Biochemistry, Clinical practice considerations.

They are used to treat a variety of immunological disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, non- Hodgkin lymphoma and ulcerative colitis. Both mercaptopurine and thioguanine can exert cytotoxic effects through the formation of thioguanine nucleotides (TGNs), active metabolites that incorporate into DNA. Mercaptopurine and thioguanine are directly inactivated by thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT). Individuals with two nonfunctional TPMT alleles are at 100% risk of potentially fatal myelosuppression, due to an increased buildup of toxic TGNs. Alternative agents or a drastically reduced dose are recommended for patients with this genotype. Patients heterozygous for a nonfunctional TPMT allele are at increased risk of myelosuppression, and reduced dosing is recommended for these individuals.
