Squamous cells are found in the outer layer of skin and in the mucous membranes, which are the moist tissues that line body cavities such as the airways and intestines. Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) develops in the mucous membranes of the mouth, nose, and throat.HNSCC is classified by its location: it can occur in the mouth (oral cavity), the middle part of the throat near the mouth (oropharynx), the space behind the nose (nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses), the upper part of the throat near the nasal cavity (nasopharynx), the voicebox (larynx), or the lower part of the throat near the larynx (hypopharynx). Depending on the location, the cancer can cause abnormal patches or open sores (ulcers) in the mouth and throat, unusual bleeding or pain in the mouth, sinus congestion that does not clear, sore throat, earache, pain when swallowing or difficulty swallowing, a hoarse voice, difficulty breathing, or enlarged lymph nodes.HNSCC can spread (metastasize) to other parts of the body, such as the lymph nodes or lungs. If it spreads, the cancer has a worse prognosis and can be fatal. About half of affected individuals survive more than five years after diagnosis.","alternate_names":["Carcinoma, squamous cell of head and neck","Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma","Squamous cell carcinoma, head and neck, somatic"],"symbol":"HNSCC","medgen_id":"C1168401","id":"4210","type":"Disease","xrefs":["{\"db\":\"MeSH\",\"id\":\"C535575\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"275355\",\"type\":\"MIM\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"67037\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Alliance\",\"id\":\"Squamous+cell+carcinoma+of+the+head+and+neck/6853\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"head-and-neck-squamous-cell-carcinoma\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"275355\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"symbol\"}"],"name":"Squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck","alternate_symbols":["midline carcinoma"],"keywords":["Hereditary cancer syndrome"]}

This condition mainly affects red blood cells, which carry oxygen from the lungs to tissues throughout the body. In affected individuals, a defect in an enzyme called glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase causes red blood cells to break down prematurely. This destruction of red blood cells is called hemolysis.The most common medical problem associated with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency is hemolytic anemia, which occurs when red blood cells are destroyed faster than the body can replace them. This type of anemia leads to paleness, yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice), dark urine, fatigue, shortness of breath, and a rapid heart rate. In people with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, hemolytic anemia is most often triggered by bacterial or viral infections or by certain drugs (such as some antibiotics and medications used to treat malaria). Hemolytic anemia can also occur after eating fava beans or inhaling pollen from fava plants (a reaction called favism).Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency is also a significant cause of mild to severe jaundice in newborns. Many people with this disorder, however, never experience any signs or symptoms and are unaware that they have the condition.","alternate_names":["G6PD A-","Hemolytic anemia due to G6PD deficiency"],"medgen_id":"C2939465","id":"7128","type":"Disease","xrefs":["{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"362\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Alliance\",\"id\":\"G6pd+a-/8448\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"G6PD A-\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"305900.0002\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"G6PD A-\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"305900.0027\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"G6PD A-\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"305900.0028\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"G6PD A-\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Alliance\",\"id\":\"Glucose+6+Phosphate+Dehydrogenase+Deficiency/3096\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase-deficiency\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}"],"name":"Glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency","alternate_symbols":[],"keywords":[]}
{"attribute_content":[],"public_definition":"Mitochondrial complex I deficiency is a shortage (deficiency) of a protein complex called complex I or a loss of its function. Complex I is found in cell structures called mitochondria, which convert the energy from food into a form that cells can use. Complex I is the first of five mitochondrial complexes that carry out a multi-step process called oxidative phosphorylation, through which cells derive much of their energy.Mitochondrial complex I deficiency can cause a wide variety of signs and symptoms affecting many organs and systems of the body, particularly the nervous system, the heart, and the muscles used for movement (skeletal muscles). These signs and symptoms can appear at any time from birth to adulthood.People with mitochondrial complex I deficiency typically have neurological problems, such as abnormal brain function (encephalopathy), recurrent seizures (epilepsy), intellectual disability, difficulty coordinating movements (ataxia), or involuntary movements (dystonia). Affected individuals may have low muscle tone (hypotonia), muscle pain (myalgia), and extreme fatigue in response to physical activity (exercise intolerance). They tend to develop elevated levels of lactic acid in the blood (lactic acidosis), which can cause nausea, vomiting, weakness, and rapid breathing. In severe cases, lactic acidosis can be life-threatening.People with mitochondrial complex I deficiency sometimes have heart, liver, or kidney problems. Vision problems due to abnormal eye movement or breakdown (degeneration) of the nerves that carry signals from the eyes to the brain (optic nerves) can also occur.Some people with mitochondrial complex I deficiency have groups of signs and symptoms that are classified as a specific syndrome. For example, a condition called Leigh syndrome is most commonly caused by mitochondrial complex I deficiency. Leigh syndrome is characterized by progressive loss of mental and movement abilities (developmental or psychomotor regression) and typically results in death within 2 to 3 years from the onset of symptoms. Another condition that can be caused by mitochondrial complex I deficiency, Leber hereditary optic neuropathy, is associated mainly with vision problems due to optic nerve degeneration. These syndromes can also have other causes.","alternate_names":["Complex 1 mitochondrial respiratory chain deficiency","NADH coenzyme Q reductase deficiency"],"medgen_id":"CN031990","id":"3208","type":"Disease","xrefs":["{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"2609\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Alliance\",\"id\":\"Mitochondrial+complex+I+deficiency/4823\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"mitochondrial-complex-i-deficiency\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}"],"name":"Mitochondrial complex I deficiency","alternate_symbols":[],"keywords":[]}

{"attribute_content":[],"public_definition":"Autosomal dominant optic atrophy and cataract is an eye disorder that is characterized by impaired vision. Most affected individuals have decreased sharpness of vision (visual acuity) from birth, while others begin to experience vision problems in early childhood or later. In affected individuals, both eyes are usually affected equally. However, the severity of the vision loss varies widely, even among affected members of the same family, ranging from nearly normal vision to complete blindness.Several abnormalities contribute to impaired vision in people with autosomal dominant optic atrophy and cataract. In the early stages of the condition, affected individuals experience a progressive loss of certain cells within the retina, which is a specialized light-sensitive tissue that lines the back of the eye. The loss of these cells (known as retinal ganglion cells) is followed by the degeneration (atrophy) of the nerves that relay visual information from the eyes to the brain (optic nerves), which contributes to vision loss. Atrophy of these nerves causes an abnormally pale appearance (pallor) of the optic nerves, which can be seen only during an eye examination. Most people with this disorder also have clouding of the lenses of the eyes (cataracts). This eye abnormality can develop anytime but typically appears in childhood. Other common eye problems in autosomal dominant optic atrophy and cataract include involuntary movements of the eyes (nystagmus), or problems with color vision (color vision deficiency) that make it difficult or impossible to distinguish between shades of blue and green.Some people with autosomal dominant optic atrophy and cataract develop disturbances in the function of other nerves (neuropathy) besides the optic nerves. These disturbances can lead to problems with balance and coordination (cerebellar ataxia), an unsteady style of walking (gait), prickling or tingling sensations (paresthesias) in the arms and legs, progressive muscle stiffness (spasticity), or rhythmic shaking (tremors). In some cases, affected individuals have hearing loss caused by abnormalities of the inner ear (sensorineural deafness).","alternate_names":["OPTIC ATROPHY 3, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT","Optic atrophy and cataract, autosomal dominant","Optic atrophy, cataract, and neurologic disorder"],"symbol":"OPA3","medgen_id":"C1833809","id":"5680","type":"Disease","xrefs":["{\"db\":\"MONDO\",\"id\":\"MONDO:0008133\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"165300\",\"type\":\"MIM\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"67036\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"165300\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"OPTIC ATROPHY 3, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Alliance\",\"id\":\"Optic+atrophy+and+cataract%2C+autosomal+dominant/5385\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"Optic atrophy and cataract, autosomal dominant\"}","{\"db\":\"MONDO\",\"id\":\"MONDO:0008133\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"autosomal-dominant-optic-atrophy-and-cataract\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"165300\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"symbol\"}"],"name":"Optic atrophy 3","alternate_symbols":[],"keywords":[]}

Fractures can occur in any bone but are most common in the extremities. DI is characterized by gray or brown teeth that may appear translucent, wear down, and break easily. COL1A1/2-OI has been classified into four types based on clinical presentation and radiographic findings. This classification system can be helpful in providing information about prognosis and management for a given individual.

Hair color ranges from white to brown; skin color ranges from white to olive and is usually a shade lighter than that of other family members. The bleeding diathesis can result in variable bruising, epistaxis, gingival bleeding, postpartum hemorrhage, colonic bleeding, and prolonged bleeding with menses or after tooth extraction, circumcision, and other surgeries. Pulmonary fibrosis, a restrictive lung disease, typically causes symptoms in the early thirties and can progress to death within a decade.

In contrast, syndromic hearing loss occurs with signs and symptoms affecting other parts of the body.Nonsyndromic hearing loss can be classified in several different ways. One common way is by the condition's pattern of inheritance: autosomal dominant (DFNA), autosomal recessive (DFNB), X-linked (DFNX), or mitochondrial (which does not have a special designation). Each of these types of hearing loss includes multiple subtypes. DFNA, DFNB, and DFNX subtypes are numbered in the order in which they were first described. For example, DFNA1 was the first type of autosomal dominant nonsyndromic hearing loss to be identified.The characteristics of nonsyndromic hearing loss vary among the different types. Hearing loss can affect one ear (unilateral) or both ears (bilateral). Degrees of hearing loss range from mild (difficulty understanding soft speech) to profound (inability to hear even very loud noises). The term \"deafness\" is often used to describe severe-to-profound hearing loss. Hearing loss can be stable, or it may be progressive, becoming more severe as a person gets older. Particular types of nonsyndromic hearing loss show distinctive patterns of hearing loss. For example, the loss may be more pronounced at high, middle, or low tones.Most forms of nonsyndromic hearing loss are described as sensorineural, which means they are associated with a permanent loss of hearing caused by damage to structures in the inner ear. The inner ear processes sound and sends the information to the brain in the form of electrical nerve impulses. Less commonly, nonsyndromic hearing loss is described as conductive, meaning it results from changes in the middle ear. The middle ear contains three tiny bones that help transfer sound from the eardrum to the inner ear. Some forms of nonsyndromic hearing loss, particularly a type called DFNX2, involve changes in both the inner ear and the middle ear. This combination is called mixed hearing loss.Depending on the type, nonsyndromic hearing loss can become apparent at any time from infancy to old age. Hearing loss that is present before a child learns to speak is classified as prelingual or congenital. Hearing loss that occurs after the development of speech is classified as postlingual.","alternate_names":["Non-syndromic genetic deafness","Nonsyndromic genetic deafness"],"medgen_id":"CN043648","id":"9544","gard_id":"6410","type":"Disease","xrefs":["{\"db\":\"MONDO\",\"id\":\"MONDO:0019497\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"87884\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"87884\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"Non-syndromic genetic deafness\"}","{\"db\":\"MONDO\",\"id\":\"MONDO:0019497\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"Nonsyndromic genetic deafness\"}","{\"db\":\"Office of Rare Diseases\",\"id\":\"6410\",\"ref_field\":\"gard_id\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"nonsyndromic-hearing-loss\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}"],"name":"Nonsyndromic hearing loss and deafness","alternate_symbols":[],"keywords":[]}

Although Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis were once thought to be separate conditions, they are now considered part of a continuum. Stevens-Johnson syndrome represents the less severe end of the disease spectrum, and toxic epidermal necrolysis represents the more severe end.SJS/TEN often begins with a fever and flu-like symptoms. Within a few days, the skin begins to blister and peel, forming very painful raw areas called erosions that resemble a severe hot-water burn. The skin erosions usually start on the face and chest before spreading to other parts of the body. In most affected individuals, the condition also damages the mucous membranes, including the lining of the mouth and the airways, which can cause trouble with swallowing and breathing. The painful blistering can also affect the urinary tract and genitals. SJS/TEN often affects the eyes as well, causing irritation and redness of the conjunctiva, which are the mucous membranes that protect the white part of the eye and line the eyelids, and damage to the clear front covering of the eye (the cornea).Severe damage to the skin and mucous membranes makes SJS/TEN a life-threatening disease. Because the skin normally acts as a protective barrier, extensive skin damage can lead to a dangerous loss of fluids and allow infections to develop. Serious complications can include pneumonia, overwhelming bacterial infections (sepsis), shock, multiple organ failure, and death. About 10 percent of people with Stevens-Johnson syndrome die from the disease, while the condition is fatal in up to 50 percent of those with toxic epidermal necrolysis.Among people who survive, long-term effects of SJS/TEN can include changes in skin coloring (pigmentation), dryness of the skin and mucous membranes (xerosis), excess sweating (hyperhidrosis), hair loss (alopecia), and abnormal growth or loss of the fingernails and toenails. Other long-term problems can include impaired taste, difficulty urinating, and genital abnormalities. A small percentage of affected individuals develop chronic dryness or inflammation of the eyes, which can lead to increased sensitivity to light (photophobia) and vision impairment.","alternate_names":["STEVENS-JOHNSON SYNDROME, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO","Stevens-Johnson syndrome"],"medgen_id":"C3241919","id":"15494","type":"Disease","xrefs":["{\"db\":\"MONDO\",\"id\":\"MONDO:0044719\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"502499\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"142830.0002\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"STEVENS-JOHNSON SYNDROME, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"142830.0004\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"STEVENS-JOHNSON SYNDROME, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"608579\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"STEVENS-JOHNSON SYNDROME, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Alliance\",\"id\":\"Stevens-Johnson+syndrome/6876\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"Stevens-Johnson syndrome\"}","{\"db\":\"MONDO\",\"id\":\"MONDO:0044719\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"stevens-johnson-syndrome-toxic-epidermal-necrolysis\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}"],"name":"Erythema multiforme major","alternate_symbols":["SJS"],"keywords":[]}

CS type I is characterized by normal prenatal growth with the onset of growth and developmental abnormalities in the first two years. By the time the disease has become fully manifest, height, weight, and head circumference are far below the fifth percentile. Progressive impairment of vision, hearing, and central and peripheral nervous system function leads to severe disability; death typically occurs in the first or second decade. CS type II is characterized by growth failure at birth, with little or no postnatal neurologic development. Congenital cataracts or other structural anomalies of the eye may be present.

The typical untreated child has short stature, rickets, and photophobia. Failure to thrive is generally noticed after approximately age six months; signs of renal tubular Fanconi syndrome (polyuria, polydipsia, dehydration, and acidosis) appear as early as age six months; corneal crystals can be present before age one year and are always present after age 16 months. Prior to the use of renal transplantation and cystine-depleting therapy, the life span in nephropathic cystinosis was no longer than ten years. With these interventions, affected individuals can survive at least into the mid-forties or fifties with satisfactory quality of life. Intermediate cystinosis is characterized by all the typical manifestations of nephropathic cystinosis, but onset is at a later age. Renal glomerular failure occurs in all untreated affected individuals, usually between ages 15 and 25 years.

Death usually occurs in the neonatal period. The congenital neuromuscular subtype presents in the newborn period with profound hypotonia, respiratory distress, and dilated cardiomyopathy. Death usually occurs in early infancy. Infants with the classic (progressive) hepatic subtype may appear normal at birth, but rapidly develop failure to thrive; hepatomegaly, liver dysfunction, and progressive liver cirrhosis; hypotonia; and cardiomyopathy. Without liver transplantation, death from liver failure usually occurs by age five years. Children with the non-progressive hepatic subtype tend to present with hepatomegaly, liver dysfunction, myopathy, and hypotonia; however, they are likely to survive without progression of the liver disease and may not show cardiac, skeletal muscle, or neurologic involvement.

It initially resembles attention-deficit disorder or hyperactivity; progressive impairment of cognition, behavior, vision, hearing, and motor function follow the initial symptoms and often lead to total disability within six months to two years. Most individuals have impaired adrenocortical function at the time that neurologic disturbances are first noted. Adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN) manifests most commonly in an individual in his twenties or middle age as progressive stiffness and weakness of the legs, sphincter disturbances, sexual dysfunction, and often, impaired adrenocortical function; all symptoms are progressive over decades. \"Addison disease only\" presents with primary adrenocortical insufficiency between age two years and adulthood and most commonly by age 7.5 years, without evidence of neurologic abnormality; however, some degree of neurologic disability (most commonly AMN) usually develops by middle age.

Adrenal function is usually normal.","alternate_names":["ADDISON DISEASE AND CEREBRAL SCLEROSIS","BRONZE SCHILDER DISEASE","MELANODERMIC LEUKODYSTROPHY","SIEMERLING-CREUTZFELDT DISEASE"],"symbol":"ALD","medgen_id":"C0162309","id":"139","disease_mechanism":"loss of function","type":"Disease","xrefs":["{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"300100\",\"type\":\"MIM\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"300100\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"ADDISON DISEASE AND CEREBRAL SCLEROSIS\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"300100\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"BRONZE SCHILDER DISEASE\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"300100\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"MELANODERMIC LEUKODYSTROPHY\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"300100\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"SIEMERLING-CREUTZFELDT DISEASE\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"300100\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_symbols\",\"ref_field_element\":\"AMN\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000500811\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_symbols\",\"ref_field_element\":\"Adrenoleukodystrophy, ID\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000070507\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000318975\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000330513\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000500811\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000500892\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000503088\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000503092\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000507942\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000508448\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000510916\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000512569\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000519128\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000520051\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000521375\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000522163\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000522267\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000522268\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000530118\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000559496\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000561876\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Alliance\",\"id\":\"Adrenoleukodystrophy/242\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"SNOMED CT\",\"id\":\"65389002\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"GeneReviews\",\"id\":\"NBK1315\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"300100\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"symbol\"}"],"name":"Adrenoleukodystrophy","alternate_symbols":["AMN","Adrenoleukodystrophy, ID","X-ALD"],"keywords":[]}

Many people with this condition are born with eyeballs that are abnormally small (microphthalmia). Other eye problems can include clouding of the lens (cataract) and a higher risk of glaucoma, an eye disease that increases the pressure in the eye. These abnormalities can lead to vision loss or blindness.People with OFCD syndrome often have a long, narrow face with distinctive facial features, including deep-set eyes and a broad nasal tip that is divided by a cleft. Some affected people have an opening in the roof of the mouth called a cleft palate.Heart defects are another common feature of OFCD syndrome. Babies with this condition may be born with a hole between two chambers of the heart (an atrial or ventricular septal defect) or a leak in one of the valves that controls blood flow through the heart (mitral valve prolapse).Teeth with very large roots (radiculomegaly) are characteristic of OFCD syndrome. Additional dental abnormalities can include delayed loss of primary (baby) teeth, missing or abnormally small teeth, misaligned teeth, and defective tooth enamel.","alternate_names":["Microphthalmia cataracts radiculomegaly and septal heart defects"],"symbol":"MCOPS2","medgen_id":"C1846265","id":"2945","type":"Disease","xrefs":["{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"300166\",\"type\":\"MIM\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Alliance\",\"id\":\"Microphthalmia+syndromic+2/4786\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"oculofaciocardiodental-syndrome\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"300166\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"symbol\"}"],"name":"Oculofaciocardiodental syndrome","alternate_symbols":[],"keywords":[]}

In those with slowly progressive disease, the CNS is not (or is minimally) affected, although the effect of GAG accumulation on other organ systems may be early progressive to the same degree as in those who have progressive cognitive decline. Survival into the early adult years with normal intelligence is common in the slowly progressing form of the disease. Additional findings in both forms of MPS II include: short stature; macrocephaly with or without communicating hydrocephalus; macroglossia; hoarse voice; conductive and sensorineural hearing loss; hepatosplenomegaly; dysostosis multiplex; spinal stenosis; and carpal tunnel syndrome.","alternate_names":["Attenuated MPS (subtype; formerly known as mild MPS II)","Hunter Syndrome","I2S deficiency","IDS deficiency","Iduronate 2-sulfatase deficiency","MPS 2","MPS II","SIDS deficiency","Severe MPS II","Sulfoiduronate sulfatase deficiency"],"symbol":"MPS2","medgen_id":"C0026705","id":"10834","type":"Disease","xrefs":["{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"309900\",\"type\":\"MIM\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"580\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"309900\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"MPS II\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Alliance\",\"id\":\"Mucopolysaccharidosis+type+II/4913\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"SNOMED CT\",\"id\":\"70737009\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"GeneReviews\",\"id\":\"NBK1274\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"309900\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"symbol\"}"],"name":"Mucopolysaccharidosis, MPS-II","alternate_symbols":[],"keywords":[]}

Cardiac and smooth muscle are usually not involved. Severity and course of disease are highly variable, ranging from minor symptoms to progressive disabling weakness. In some subtypes of CMS, myasthenic symptoms may be mild, but sudden severe exacerbations of weakness or even sudden episodes of respiratory insufficiency may be precipitated by fever, infections, or excitement. Major findings of the neonatal-onset subtype include: respiratory insufficiency with sudden apnea and cyanosis; feeding difficulties; poor suck and cry; choking spells; eyelid ptosis; and facial, bulbar, and generalized weakness. Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita may also be present. Stridor in infancy may be an important clue to CMS. Later childhood-onset subtypes show abnormal muscle fatigability with difficulty in activities such as running or climbing stairs; motor milestones may be delayed; fluctuating eyelid ptosis and fixed or fluctuating extraocular muscle weakness are common presentations.","alternate_names":["MYASTHENIC SYNDROME, CONGENITAL, 5"],"symbol":"CMS5","medgen_id":"C1864233","id":"1153","type":"Disease","xrefs":["{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"603034\",\"type\":\"MIM\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"590\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"603033.0001\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"MYASTHENIC SYNDROME, CONGENITAL, 5\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"603033.0002\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"MYASTHENIC SYNDROME, CONGENITAL, 5\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"603033.0003\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"MYASTHENIC SYNDROME, CONGENITAL, 5\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"603033.0004\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"MYASTHENIC SYNDROME, CONGENITAL, 5\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"603033.0005\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"MYASTHENIC SYNDROME, CONGENITAL, 5\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"603033.0006\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"MYASTHENIC SYNDROME, CONGENITAL, 5\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"603033.0007\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"MYASTHENIC SYNDROME, CONGENITAL, 5\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"603033.0008\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"MYASTHENIC SYNDROME, CONGENITAL, 5\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"603033.0009\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"MYASTHENIC SYNDROME, CONGENITAL, 5\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"603033.0010\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"MYASTHENIC SYNDROME, CONGENITAL, 5\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"603034\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"MYASTHENIC SYNDROME, CONGENITAL, 5\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"603034\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_symbols\",\"ref_field_element\":\"EAD\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Alliance\",\"id\":\"Endplate+acetylcholinesterase+deficiency/8313\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"GeneReviews\",\"id\":\"NBK1168\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"603034\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"symbol\"}"],"name":"Endplate acetylcholinesterase deficiency","alternate_symbols":["EAD"],"keywords":[]}

Severe MPS I. Infants appear normal at birth. Typical early manifestations are nonspecific (e.g., umbilical or inguinal hernia, frequent upper respiratory-tract infections before age 1 year). Coarsening of the facial features may not become apparent until after age one year. Gibbus deformity of the lower spine is common and often noted within the first year. Progressive skeletal dysplasia (dysostosis multiplex) involving all bones is universal. By age three years, linear growth decreases. Intellectual disability is progressive and profound. Hearing loss is common. Death, typically caused by cardiorespiratory failure, usually occurs within the first ten years of life. Attenuated MPS I. The severity and rate of disease progression range from serious life-threatening complications leading to death in the second to third decades to a normal life span complicated by significant disability from progressive joint manifestations and cardiorespiratory disease. While some individuals have no neurologic involvement and psychomotor development may be normal in early childhood, learning disabilities can be present.

Peripheral nerves connect the brain and spinal cord to muscles and to sensory cells that detect sensations such as touch, pain, heat, and sound. Damage to the peripheral nerves that worsens over time can result in alteration or loss of sensation and wasting (atrophy) of muscles in the feet, legs, and hands.Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease usually becomes apparent in adolescence or early adulthood, but onset may occur anytime from early childhood through late adulthood. Symptoms of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease vary in severity and age of onset even among members of the same family. Some people never realize they have the disorder because their symptoms are so mild, but most have a moderate amount of physical disability. A small percentage of people experience severe weakness or other problems which, in very rare cases, can be life-threatening. In most affected individuals, however, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease does not affect life expectancy.Typically, the earliest symptoms of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease result from muscle atrophy in the feet. Affected individuals may have foot abnormalities such as high arches (pes cavus), flat feet (pes planus), or curled toes (hammer toes). They often have difficulty flexing the foot or walking on the heel of the foot. These difficulties may cause a higher than normal step (steppage gait) and increase the risk of ankle injuries and tripping. As the disease worsens, muscles in the lower legs usually weaken, but leg and foot problems rarely require the use of a wheelchair.Affected individuals may also develop weakness in the hands, causing difficulty with daily activities such as writing, fastening buttons, and turning doorknobs. People with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease typically experience a decreased sensitivity to touch, heat, and cold in the feet and lower legs, but occasionally feel aching or burning sensations. In rare cases, affected individuals have loss of vision or gradual hearing loss that sometimes leads to deafness.There are several types of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, which are differentiated by their effects on nerve cells and patterns of inheritance. Type 1 (CMT1) is characterized by abnormalities in myelin, the fatty substance that covers nerve cells, protecting them and helping to transmit nerve impulses. These abnormalities slow the transmission of nerve impulses and can affect the health of the nerve fiber. Type 2 (CMT2) is characterized by abnormalities in the fiber, or axon, that extends from a nerve cell body to muscles or to sense organs. These abnormalities reduce the strength of the nerve impulse. In forms of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease classified as intermediate type, the nerve impulses are both slowed and reduced in strength, probably due to abnormalities in both myelin and axons. Type 4 (CMT4) is distinguished from the other types by its pattern of inheritance; it can affect either the axons or the myelin. Type X Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMTX) is caused by mutations in genes on the X chromosome, one of the two sex chromosomes. Within the various types of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, subtypes (such as CMT1A, CMT1B, CMT2A, CMT4A, and CMTX1) indicate different genetic causes.Sometimes other, historical names are used to refer to particular forms of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. For example, Roussy-Levy syndrome is a form of CMT11 with the additional feature of rhythmic shaking (tremors). Dejerine-Sottas syndrome is a term sometimes used to describe a severe, early childhood form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease; it is also sometimes called type 3 (CMT3). Depending on the specific gene that is altered, this severe, early-onset form of the disorder may also be classified as CMT1 or CMT4. CMTX5 is also known as Rosenberg-Chutorian syndrome.","alternate_names":["CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH DISEASE, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT, TYPE 2K","CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH DISEASE, AXONAL, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT, TYPE 2K","CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH NEUROPATHY, AXONAL, TYPE 2K","Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, axonal, Type 2K","Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, axonal, autosomal recessive, Type 2K"],"symbol":"CMT2K","medgen_id":"C1842983","id":"782","type":"Disease","xrefs":["{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"607831\",\"type\":\"MIM\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"99944\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"606598.0014\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH DISEASE, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT, TYPE 2K\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"606598.0015\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH DISEASE, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT, TYPE 2K\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"606598.0017\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH DISEASE, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT, TYPE 2K\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"606598.0018\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH DISEASE, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT, TYPE 2K\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"606598.0019\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH DISEASE, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT, TYPE 2K\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"607831\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH DISEASE, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT, TYPE 2K\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"606598.0009\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH DISEASE, AXONAL, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT, TYPE 2K\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"606598.0010\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH DISEASE, AXONAL, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT, TYPE 2K\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"606598.0012\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH DISEASE, AXONAL, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT, TYPE 2K\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"607831\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH NEUROPATHY, AXONAL, TYPE 2K\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Alliance\",\"id\":\"Charcot-Marie-Tooth+Disease+Type+2K/1302\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"charcot-marie-tooth-disease\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"607831\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"symbol\"}"],"name":"Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2K","alternate_symbols":["CMT 2K"],"keywords":[]}

Individuals with thalassemia major have severe anemia and hepatosplenomegaly; they usually come to medical attention within the first two years of life. Without treatment, affected children have severe failure to thrive and shortened life expectancy. Treatment with a regular transfusion program and chelation therapy, aimed at reducing transfusion iron overload, allows for normal growth and development and may improve the overall prognosis. Individuals with thalassemia intermedia present later and have milder anemia that does not require regular treatment with blood transfusion.

The classic form, occurring in males with less than 1% a-Gal A enzyme activity, usually has its onset in childhood or adolescence with periodic crises of severe pain in the extremities (acroparesthesia), the appearance of vascular cutaneous lesions (angiokeratomas), sweating abnormalities (anhidrosis, hypohidrosis, and rarely hyperhidrosis), characteristic corneal and lenticular opacities, and proteinuria. Gradual deterioration of renal function to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) usually occurs in men in the third to fifth decade. In middle age, most males successfully treated for ESRD develop cardiac and/or cerebrovascular disease, a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Heterozygous females typically have milder symptoms at a later age of onset than males. Rarely, they may be relatively asymptomatic throughout a normal life span or may have symptoms as severe as those observed in males with the classic phenotype. In contrast, males with greater than 1% a-Gal A activity may have: (1) a cardiac variant phenotype that usually presents in the sixth to eighth decade with left ventricular hypertrophy, cardiomyopathy and arrhythmia, and proteinuria, but without ESRD; or (2) a renal variant phenotype, associated with ESRD but without the skin lesions or pain; or (3) cerebrovascular disease presenting as stroke or transient ischemic attack.","alternate_names":["Alpha-galactosidase A deficiency","Anderson-Fabry disease","Angiokeratoma corporis diffusum","Angiokeratoma, diffuse","Ceramide trihexosidase deficiency","Ceramide trihexosidosis","Fabry syndrome","Fabry's disease","GLA deficiency","Hereditary dystopic lipidosis"],"medgen_id":"C0002986","id":"1790","disease_mechanism":"loss of function","gard_id":"6400","type":"Disease","xrefs":["{\"db\":\"Human Phenotype Ontology\",\"id\":\"HP:0001071\",\"type\":\"primary\"}","{\"db\":\"MONDO\",\"id\":\"MONDO:0010526\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"301500\",\"type\":\"MIM\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"324\"}","{\"db\":\"Human Phenotype Ontology\",\"id\":\"HP:0001071\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"Angiokeratoma corporis diffusum\"}","{\"db\":\"Human Phenotype Ontology\",\"id\":\"HP:0001071\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"Fabry syndrome\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Alliance\",\"id\":\"Fabry+Disease/2690\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"Fabry's disease\"}","{\"db\":\"SNOMED CT\",\"id\":\"16652001\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"Fabry's disease\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000246735\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000260631\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000325415\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000505068\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000507480\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000507942\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000512526\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000514924\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000520063\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000520414\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000520447\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000522527\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000528276\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000528500\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000528516\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000528528\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000528536\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000551442\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000552214\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000556501\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000556520\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000558532\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000568367\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Office of Rare Diseases\",\"id\":\"6400\",\"ref_field\":\"gard_id\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"fabry-disease\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"GeneReviews\",\"id\":\"NBK1292\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}"],"name":"Fabry disease","alternate_symbols":[],"keywords":[]}

Without prompt diagnosis and management, this is followed by progressive encephalopathy manifesting as lethargy, seizures, or coma that can result in death. It is frequently accompanied by metabolic acidosis with anion gap, lactic acidosis, ketonuria, hypoglycemia, hyperammonemia, and cytopenias. Individuals with late-onset PA may remain asymptomatic and suffer a metabolic crisis under catabolic stress (e.g., illness, surgery, fasting) or may experience a more insidious onset with the development of multiorgan complications including vomiting, protein intolerance, failure to thrive, hypotonia, developmental delays or regression, movement disorders, or cardiomyopathy. Isolated cardiomyopathy can be observed on rare occasion in the absence of clinical metabolic decompensation or neurocognitive deficits. Manifestations of neonatal and late-onset PA over time can include growth impairment, intellectual disability, seizures, basal ganglia lesions, pancreatitis, and cardiomyopathy.

Although the absence of paramyotonia (muscle stiffness aggravated by cold and exercise) was originally postulated as a means of distinguishing hyperPP from paramyotonia congenita (PMC), approximately 45% of individuals with hyperPP have paramyotonia. In approximately half of affected individuals, attacks of flaccid muscle weakness begin in the first decade of life, with 25% reporting their first attack at age ten years or older. Initially infrequent, the attacks then increase in frequency and severity over time until approximately age 50 years, after which the frequency of attacks declines considerably. Potassium-rich food or rest after exercise may precipitate an attack. A cold environment and emotional stress provoke or worsen the attacks. A spontaneous attack commonly starts in the morning before breakfast, lasts for 15 minutes to one hour, and then disappears. Cardiac arrhythmia or respiratory insufficiency usually does not occur during attacks. Between attacks, approximately half of individuals with hyperPP have mild myotonia (muscle stiffness) that does not impede voluntary movements. More than 80% of individuals with hyperPP older than 40 years report permanent muscle weakness and about one third develop a chronic progressive myopathy.","alternate_names":["Adynamia episodica hereditaria with or without myotonia","Gamstorp disease","Gamstorp episodic adynamy","Periodic hyperkalemic paralysis","Sodium channel muscle disease"],"medgen_id":"C0238357","id":"9510","type":"Disease","xrefs":["{\"db\":\"Human Phenotype Ontology\",\"id\":\"HP:0007215\",\"type\":\"primary\"}","{\"db\":\"SNOMED CT\",\"id\":\"278513006\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"Gamstorp disease\"}","{\"db\":\"Human Phenotype Ontology\",\"id\":\"HP:0007215\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"Periodic hyperkalemic paralysis\"}","{\"db\":\"SNOMED CT\",\"id\":\"278513006\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"GeneReviews\",\"id\":\"NBK1496\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}"],"name":"Familial hyperkalemic periodic paralysis","alternate_symbols":["HYPP"],"keywords":[]}

In this form of diabetes, the body stops using and making insulin properly. Insulin is a hormone produced in the pancreas that helps regulate blood sugar levels. Specifically, insulin controls how much glucose (a type of sugar) is passed from the blood into cells, where it is used as an energy source. When blood sugar levels are high (such as after a meal), the pancreas releases insulin to move the excess glucose into cells, which reduces the amount of glucose in the blood.Most people who develop type 2 diabetes first have insulin resistance, a condition in which the body's cells use insulin less efficiently than normal. As insulin resistance develops, more and more insulin is needed to keep blood sugar levels in the normal range. To keep up with the increasing need, insulin-producing cells in the pancreas (called beta cells) make larger amounts of insulin. Over time, the beta cells become less able to respond to blood sugar changes, leading to an insulin shortage that prevents the body from reducing blood sugar levels effectively. Most people have some insulin resistance as they age, but inadequate exercise and excessive weight gain make it worse, greatly increasing the likelihood of developing type 2 diabetes.Type 2 diabetes can occur at any age, but it most commonly begins in middle age or later. Signs and symptoms develop slowly over years. They include frequent urination (polyuria), excessive thirst (polydipsia), fatigue, blurred vision, tingling or loss of feeling in the hands and feet (diabetic neuropathy), sores that do not heal well, and weight loss. If blood sugar levels are not controlled through medication or diet, type 2 diabetes can cause long-lasting (chronic) health problems including heart disease and stroke; nerve damage; and damage to the kidneys, eyes, and other parts of the body.","alternate_names":["DIABETES MELLITUS, TYPE 2, PROTECTION AGAINST","DIABETES MELLITUS, TYPE II, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO","Diabetes mellitus Type II","NIDDM diabetes mellitus","Non-insulin dependent diabetes","Noninsulin-dependent diabetes","Noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus","Type 2 diabetes","Type II diabetes"],"symbol":"NIDDM","medgen_id":"C0011860","id":"4949","type":"Disease","xrefs":["{\"db\":\"Human Phenotype Ontology\",\"id\":\"HP:0005965\",\"type\":\"secondary\"}","{\"db\":\"Human Phenotype Ontology\",\"id\":\"HP:0005978\",\"type\":\"primary\"}","{\"db\":\"Human Phenotype Ontology\",\"id\":\"HP:0100652\",\"type\":\"secondary\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"125853\",\"type\":\"MIM\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"125853\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"DIABETES MELLITUS, TYPE 2, PROTECTION AGAINST\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"611145.0002\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"DIABETES MELLITUS, TYPE 2, PROTECTION AGAINST\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"611145.0003\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"DIABETES MELLITUS, TYPE 2, PROTECTION AGAINST\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"142410.0008\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"DIABETES MELLITUS, TYPE II, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"600733.0002\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"DIABETES MELLITUS, TYPE II, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"600733.0003\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"DIABETES MELLITUS, TYPE II, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"600733.0004\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"DIABETES MELLITUS, TYPE II, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"600733.0005\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"DIABETES MELLITUS, TYPE II, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"600733.0006\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"DIABETES MELLITUS, TYPE II, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"600733.0008\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"DIABETES MELLITUS, TYPE II, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO\"}","{\"db\":\"Human Phenotype Ontology\",\"id\":\"HP:0005978\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"Diabetes mellitus Type II\"}","{\"db\":\"Human Phenotype Ontology\",\"id\":\"HP:0005978\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"NIDDM diabetes mellitus\"}","{\"db\":\"Human Phenotype Ontology\",\"id\":\"HP:0005978\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"Non-insulin dependent diabetes\"}","{\"db\":\"Human Phenotype Ontology\",\"id\":\"HP:0005978\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"Noninsulin-dependent diabetes\"}","{\"db\":\"Human Phenotype Ontology\",\"id\":\"HP:0005978\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"Noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus\"}","{\"db\":\"Human Phenotype Ontology\",\"id\":\"HP:0005978\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"Type 2 diabetes\"}","{\"db\":\"Human Phenotype Ontology\",\"id\":\"HP:0005978\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"Type II diabetes\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"125853\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_symbols\",\"ref_field_element\":\"T2D\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Alliance\",\"id\":\"Diabetes+mellitus+type+2/8215\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Human Phenotype Ontology\",\"id\":\"HP:0005978\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"SNOMED CT\",\"id\":\"44054006\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"type-2-diabetes\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}","{\"db\":\"Human Phenotype Ontology\",\"id\":\"HP:0005978\",\"ref_field\":\"symbol\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"125853\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"symbol\"}"],"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","alternate_symbols":["T2D"],"keywords":[]}

Although breast cancer is much more common in women, this form of cancer can also develop in men. In both women and men, the most common form of breast cancer begins in cells lining the milk ducts (ductal cancer). In women, cancer can also develop in the glands that produce milk (lobular cancer). Most men have little or no lobular tissue, so lobular cancer in men is very rare.In its early stages, breast cancer usually does not cause pain and may exhibit no noticeable symptoms. As the cancer progresses, signs and symptoms can include a lump or thickening in or near the breast; a change in the size or shape of the breast; nipple discharge, tenderness, or retraction (turning inward); and skin irritation, dimpling, redness, or scaliness. However, these changes can occur as part of many different conditions. Having one or more of these symptoms does not mean that a person definitely has breast cancer.In some cases, cancerous tumors can invade surrounding tissue and spread to other parts of the body. If breast cancer spreads, cancerous cells most often appear in the bones, liver, lungs, or brain. Tumors that begin at one site and then spread to other areas of the body are called metastatic cancers.A small percentage of all breast cancers cluster in families. These cancers are described as hereditary and are associated with inherited gene mutations. Hereditary breast cancers tend to develop earlier in life than noninherited (sporadic) cases, and new (primary) tumors are more likely to develop in both breasts.","alternate_names":["Breast

On imaging studies, small-vessel brain disease is manifest as diffuse periventricular leukoencephalopathy, lacunar infarcts, microhemorrhage, dilated perivascular spaces, and deep intracerebral hemorrhages. Clinically, small-vessel brain disease manifests as infantile hemiparesis, seizures, single or recurrent hemorrhagic stroke, ischemic stroke, and isolated migraine with aura. Porencephaly (fluid-filled cavities in the brain detected by CT or MRI) is typically manifest as infantile hemiparesis, seizures, and intellectual disability; however, on occasion it can be an incidental finding. HANAC (hereditary angiopathy with nephropathy, aneurysms, and muscle cramps) syndrome usually associates asymptomatic small-vessel brain disease, cerebral large vessel involvement (i.e., aneurysms), and systemic findings involving the kidney, muscle, and small vessels of the eye.

Although Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis were once thought to be separate conditions, they are now considered part of a continuum. Stevens-Johnson syndrome represents the less severe end of the disease spectrum, and toxic epidermal necrolysis represents the more severe end.SJS/TEN often begins with a fever and flu-like symptoms. Within a few days, the skin begins to blister and peel, forming very painful raw areas called erosions that resemble a severe hot-water burn. The skin erosions usually start on the face and chest before spreading to other parts of the body. In most affected individuals, the condition also damages the mucous membranes, including the lining of the mouth and the airways, which can cause trouble with swallowing and breathing. The painful blistering can also affect the urinary tract and genitals. SJS/TEN often affects the eyes as well, causing irritation and redness of the conjunctiva, which are the mucous membranes that protect the white part of the eye and line the eyelids, and damage to the clear front covering of the eye (the cornea).Severe damage to the skin and mucous membranes makes SJS/TEN a life-threatening disease. Because the skin normally acts as a protective barrier, extensive skin damage can lead to a dangerous loss of fluids and allow infections to develop. Serious complications can include pneumonia, overwhelming bacterial infections (sepsis), shock, multiple organ failure, and death. About 10 percent of people with Stevens-Johnson syndrome die from the disease, while the condition is fatal in up to 50 percent of those with toxic epidermal necrolysis.Among people who survive, long-term effects of SJS/TEN can include changes in skin coloring (pigmentation), dryness of the skin and mucous membranes (xerosis), excess sweating (hyperhidrosis), hair loss (alopecia), and abnormal growth or loss of the fingernails and toenails. Other long-term problems can include impaired taste, difficulty urinating, and genital abnormalities. A small percentage of affected individuals develop chronic dryness or inflammation of the eyes, which can lead to increased sensitivity to light (photophobia) and vision impairment.","alternate_names":["Mucocutaneous exfoliative disease","Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome","TOXIC EPIDERMAL NECROLYSIS, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO"],"medgen_id":"C0014518","id":"15568","type":"Disease","xrefs":["{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"142830.0002\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"TOXIC EPIDERMAL NECROLYSIS, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"142830.0004\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"TOXIC EPIDERMAL NECROLYSIS, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"608579\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"TOXIC EPIDERMAL NECROLYSIS, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"stevens-johnson-syndrome-toxic-epidermal-necrolysis\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}"],"name":"Toxic epidermal necrolysis","alternate_symbols":["SSSS","TEN"],"keywords":[]}

While individual phenotypes (e.g., Zellweger syndrome [ZS], neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy [NALD], and infantile Refsum disease [IRD]) were described in the past before the biochemical and molecular bases of this spectrum were fully determined, the term \"ZSD\" is now used to refer to all individuals with a PEX gene defect regardless of phenotype. Individuals with ZSD usually come to clinical attention in the newborn period or later in childhood. Affected newborns are hypotonic and feed poorly. They have distinctive facies, congenital malformations (neuronal migration defects associated with neonatal-onset seizures, renal cysts, and bony stippling [chondrodysplasia punctata] of the patella[e] and other long bones), and liver disease that can be severe. Infants with severe ZSD are significantly impaired and typically die during the first year of life, usually having made no developmental progress. Individuals with intermediate/milder ZSD do not have congenital malformations, but rather progressive peroxisome dysfunction variably manifest as sensory loss (secondary to retinal dystrophy and sensorineural hearing loss); neurologic involvement (ataxia, polyneuropathy, and leukodystrophy); liver dysfunction; adrenal insufficiency; and renal oxalate stones. While hypotonia and developmental delays are typical, intellect can be normal.

{"attribute_content":[],"public_definition":"Lactate dehydrogenase deficiency is a condition that affects how the body breaks down sugar to use as energy in cells, primarily muscle cells.There are two types of this condition: lactate dehydrogenase-A deficiency (sometimes called glycogen storage disease XI) and lactate dehydrogenase-B deficiency.People with lactate dehydrogenase-A deficiency experience fatigue, muscle pain, and cramps during exercise (exercise intolerance). In some people with lactate dehydrogenase-A deficiency, high-intensity exercise or other strenuous activity leads to the breakdown of muscle tissue (rhabdomyolysis). The destruction of muscle tissue releases a protein called myoglobin, which is processed by the kidneys and released in the urine (myoglobinuria). Myoglobin causes the urine to be red or brown. This protein can also damage the kidneys, in some cases leading to life-threatening kidney failure. Some people with lactate dehydrogenase-A deficiency develop skin rashes. The severity of the signs and symptoms among individuals with lactate dehydrogenase-A deficiency varies greatly.People with lactate dehydrogenase-B deficiency typically do not have any signs or symptoms of the condition. They do not have difficulty with physical activity or any specific physical features related to the condition. Affected individuals are usually discovered only when routine blood tests reveal reduced lactate dehydrogenase activity.","alternate_names":[],"symbol":"LDHBD","medgen_id":"C3279904","id":"11368","type":"Disease","xrefs":["{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"614128\",\"type\":\"MIM\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"284435\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Alliance\",\"id\":\"Lactate+dehydrogenase+deficiency+type+B/4069\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"lactate-dehydrogenase-deficiency\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"614128\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"symbol\"}"],"name":"Lactate dehydrogenase B deficiency","alternate_symbols":[],"keywords":[]}

In this form of cancer, certain cells in the ovary become abnormal and multiply uncontrollably to form a tumor. The ovaries are the female reproductive organs in which egg cells are produced. In about 90 percent of cases, ovarian cancer occurs after age 40, and most cases occur after age 60.The most common form of ovarian cancer begins in epithelial cells, which are the cells that line the surfaces and cavities of the body. These cancers can arise in the epithelial cells on the surface of the ovary. However, researchers suggest that many or even most ovarian cancers begin in epithelial cells on the fringes (fimbriae) at the end of one of the fallopian tubes, and the cancerous cells migrate to the ovary.Cancer can also begin in epithelial cells that form the lining of the abdomen (the peritoneum). This form of cancer, called primary peritoneal cancer, resembles epithelial ovarian cancer in its origin, symptoms, progression, and treatment. Primary peritoneal cancer often spreads to the ovaries. It can also occur even if the ovaries have been removed. Because cancers that begin in the ovaries, fallopian tubes, and peritoneum are so similar and spread easily from one of these structures to the others, they are often difficult to distinguish. These cancers are so closely related that they are generally considered collectively by experts.In about 10 percent of cases, ovarian cancer develops not in epithelial cells but in germ cells, which are precursors to egg cells, or in hormone-producing ovarian cells called granulosa cells.In its early stages, ovarian cancer usually does not cause noticeable symptoms. As the cancer progresses, signs and symptoms can include pain or a feeling of heaviness in the pelvis or lower abdomen, bloating, feeling full quickly when eating, back pain, vaginal bleeding between menstrual periods or after menopause, or changes in urinary or bowel habits. However, these changes can occur as part of many different conditions. Having one or more of these symptoms does not mean that a woman has ovarian cancer.In some cases, cancerous tumors can invade surrounding tissue and spread to other parts of the body. If ovarian cancer spreads, cancerous tumors most often appear in the abdominal cavity or on the surfaces of nearby organs such as the bladder or colon. Tumors that begin at one site and then spread to other areas of the body are called metastatic cancers.Some ovarian cancers cluster in families. These cancers are described as hereditary and are associated with inherited gene mutations. Hereditary ovarian cancers tend to develop earlier in life than non-inherited (sporadic) cases.Because it is often diagnosed at a late stage, ovarian cancer can be difficult to treat; it leads to the deaths of about 14,000 women annually in the United States, more than any other gynecological cancer. However, when it is diagnosed and treated early, the 5-year survival rate is high.","alternate_names":[],"medgen_id":"C1140680","id":"15091","type":"Disease","xrefs":["{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"ovarian-cancer\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}"],"name":"Ovarian cancer","alternate_symbols":[],"keywords":[]}

{"attribute_content":[],"public_definition":"Genetic epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (GEFS+) is a spectrum of seizure disorders of varying severity. GEFS+ is usually diagnosed in families whose members have a combination of febrile seizures, which are triggered by a high fever, and recurrent seizures (epilepsy) of other types, including seizures that are not related to fevers (afebrile seizures). The additional seizure types usually involve both sides of the brain (generalized seizures); however, seizures that involve only one side of the brain (partial seizures) occur in some affected individuals. The most common types of seizure in people with GEFS+ include myoclonic seizures, which cause involuntary muscle twitches; atonic seizures, which involve sudden episodes of weak muscle tone; and absence seizures, which cause loss of consciousness for short periods that appear as staring spells.The most common and mildest feature of the GEFS+ spectrum is simple febrile seizures, which begin in infancy and usually stop by age 5. When the febrile seizures continue after age 5 or other types of seizure develop, the condition is called febrile seizures plus (FS+). Seizures in FS+ usually end in early adolescence.A condition called Dravet syndrome (also known as severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy or SMEI) is often considered part of the GEFS+ spectrum and is the most severe disorder in this group. Affected infants typically have prolonged seizures lasting several minutes (status epilepticus), which are triggered by fever. Other seizure types, including afebrile seizures, begin in early childhood. These types can include myoclonic or absence seizures. In Dravet syndrome, these seizures are difficult to control with medication, and they can worsen over time. A decline in brain function is also common in Dravet syndrome. Affected individuals usually develop normally in the first year of life, but then development stalls, and some affected children lose already-acquired skills (developmental regression). Many people with Dravet syndrome have difficulty coordinating movements (ataxia) and intellectual disability.Some people with GEFS+ have seizure disorders of intermediate severity that may not fit into the classical diagnosis of simple febrile seizures, FS+, or Dravet syndrome.Family members with GEFS+ may have different combinations of febrile seizures and epilepsy. For example, one affected family member may have only febrile seizures, while another also has myoclonic epilepsy. While GEFS+ is usually diagnosed in families, it can occur in individuals with no history of the condition in their family.","alternate_names":[],"symbol":"GEFSP5","medgen_id":"C3501643","id":"12493","type":"Disease","xrefs":["{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"613060\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_symbols\",\"ref_field_element\":\"GEFS5\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"genetic-epilepsy-with-febrile-seizures-plus\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}"],"name":"Generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus type 5","alternate_symbols":["GEFS5"],"keywords":[]}

The signs and symptoms of Larsen syndrome vary widely even within the same family. Affected individuals are usually born with dislocations of the hips, knees, or elbows. Foot abnormalities, such as inward- and upward-turning feet (clubfeet), are also common. Affected individuals generally have small extra bones in their wrists and ankles that are visible on x-ray images. The tips of their fingers, especially the thumbs, are typically blunt and square-shaped (spatulate).Characteristic facial features in people with Larsen syndrome include a prominent forehead (frontal bossing), flattening of the bridge of the nose and middle of the face (midface hypoplasia), and wide-set eyes (ocular hypertelorism). Many people with Larsen syndrome have an opening in the roof of the mouth (a cleft palate). Affected individuals may also have hearing loss caused by malformations in tiny bones in the ears (ossicles).Short stature is a common feature of Larsen syndrome. In addition, people with the condition may have an unusually large range of joint movement (hypermobility) or joint deformities (contractures) that restrict movement. People with Larsen syndrome can also have abnormal curvature of the spine (kyphosis or scoliosis) that can impair breathing or compress the spinal cord and lead to weakness of the limbs. Some affected individuals experience respiratory problems, such as partial closing of the airways, short pauses in breathing (apnea), and frequent respiratory infections. Heart and kidney problems can also occur in people with Larsen syndrome. People with this condition can survive into adulthood.

Factor V Leiden is the name of a specific gene mutation that results in thrombophilia, which is an increased tendency to form abnormal blood clots that can block blood vessels.People with factor V Leiden thrombophilia have a higher than average risk of developing a type of blood clot called a deep venous thrombosis (DVT). DVTs occur most often in the legs, although they can also occur in other parts of the body, including the brain, eyes, liver, and kidneys. Factor V Leiden thrombophilia also increases the risk that clots will break away from their original site and travel through the bloodstream. These clots can lodge in the lungs, where they are known as pulmonary emboli. Although factor V Leiden thrombophilia increases the risk of blood clots, only about 10 percent of individuals with the factor V Leiden mutation ever develop abnormal clots.The factor V Leiden mutation is associated with a slightly increased risk of pregnancy loss (miscarriage). Women with this mutation are two to three times more likely to have multiple (recurrent) miscarriages or a pregnancy loss during the second or third trimester. Some research suggests that the factor V Leiden mutation may also increase the risk of other complications during pregnancy, including pregnancy-induced high blood pressure (preeclampsia), slow fetal growth, and early separation of the placenta from the uterine wall (placental abruption). However, the association between the factor V Leiden mutation and these complications has not been confirmed.
