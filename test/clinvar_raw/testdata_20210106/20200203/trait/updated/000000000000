In 80% of individuals, aganglionosis is restricted to the rectosigmoid colon (short-segment disease); in 15%-20%, aganglionosis extends proximal to the sigmoid colon (long-segment disease); in about 5%, aganglionosis affects the entire large intestine (total colonic aganglionosis). Rarely, the aganglionosis extends into the small bowel or even more proximally to encompass the entire bowel (total intestinal aganglionosis). HSCR is considered a neurocristopathy, a disorder of cells and tissues derived from the neural crest, and may occur as an isolated finding or as part of a multisystem disorder. Affected infants frequently present in the first two months of life with symptoms of impaired intestinal motility such as failure to pass meconium within the first 48 hours of life, constipation, emesis, abdominal pain or distention, and occasionally diarrhea. However, because the initial diagnosis of HSCR may be delayed until late childhood or adulthood, HSCR should be considered in anyone with lifelong severe constipation.

{"attribute_content":[],"public_definition":"Malignant hyperthermia susceptibility (MHS) is a pharmacogenetic disorder of skeletal muscle calcium regulation associated with uncontrolled skeletal muscle hypermetabolism. Manifestations of malignant hyperthermia (MH) are precipitated by certain volatile anesthetics (i.e., halothane, isoflurane, sevoflurane, desflurane, enflurane), either alone or in conjunction with a depolarizing muscle relaxant (specifically, succinylcholine). The triggering substances cause uncontrolled release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum and may promote entry of extracellular calcium into the myoplasm, causing contracture of skeletal muscles, glycogenolysis, and increased cellular metabolism, resulting in production of heat and excess lactate. Affected individuals experience acidosis, hypercapnia, tachycardia, hyperthermia, muscle rigidity, compartment syndrome, rhabdomyolysis with subsequent increase in serum creatine kinase (CK) concentration, hyperkalemia with a risk for cardiac arrhythmia or even cardiac arrest, and myoglobinuria with a risk for renal failure. In nearly all cases, the first manifestations of MH (tachycardia and tachypnea) occur in the operating room; however, MH may also occur in the early postoperative period. There is mounting evidence that some individuals with MHS will also develop MH with exercise and/or on exposure to hot environments.

The disorder affects several regions of the brain, especially an area called the substantia nigra that controls balance and movement.Often the first symptom of Parkinson disease is trembling or shaking (tremor) of a limb, especially when the body is at rest. Typically, the tremor begins on one side of the body, usually in one hand. Tremors can also affect the arms, legs, feet, and face. Other characteristic symptoms of Parkinson disease include rigidity or stiffness of the limbs and torso, slow movement (bradykinesia) or an inability to move (akinesia), and impaired balance and coordination (postural instability). These symptoms worsen slowly over time.Parkinson disease can also affect emotions and thinking ability (cognition). Some affected individuals develop psychiatric conditions such as depression and visual hallucinations. People with Parkinson disease also have an increased risk of developing dementia, which is a decline in intellectual functions including judgment and memory.Generally, Parkinson disease that begins after age 50 is called late-onset disease. The condition is described as early-onset disease if signs and symptoms begin before age 50. Early-onset cases that begin before age 20 are sometimes referred to as juvenile-onset Parkinson disease.","symbol":"PD","medgen_id":"C3160718","alternate_names":["PARKINSON DISEASE, AGE OF ONSET, MODIFIER","PARKINSON DISEASE, LATE-ONSET, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO","Parkinson's disease"],"type":"Disease","alternate_symbols":["PARK"],"xrefs":["{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"168600\",\"type\":\"MIM\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"300144.0001\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"PARKINSON DISEASE, AGE OF ONSET, MODIFIER\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"157140.0021\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"PARKINSON DISEASE, LATE-ONSET, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"600075.0001\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"PARKINSON DISEASE, LATE-ONSET, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"601517.0001\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"PARKINSON DISEASE, LATE-ONSET, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"603680.0001\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"PARKINSON DISEASE, LATE-ONSET, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"606463.0008\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"PARKINSON DISEASE, LATE-ONSET, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"606463.0048\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"PARKINSON DISEASE, LATE-ONSET, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"607047.0001\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"PARKINSON DISEASE, LATE-ONSET, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Alliance\",\"id\":\"Parkinson+Disease/5603\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"Parkinson's disease\"}","{\"db\":\"SNOMED CT\",\"id\":\"49049000\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"Parkinson's disease\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"168600\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_symbols\",\"ref_field_element\":\"PARK\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"parkinson-disease\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"168600\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"symbol\"}"],"name":"Parkinson disease, late-onset","keywords":[],"content":"{\"Citation\":[{\"@Abbrev\":\"GeneReviews\",\"@Type\":\"review\",\"ID\":[{\"$\":\"20301402\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"},{\"$\":\"NBK1223\",\"@Source\":\"BookShelf\"}]},{\"@Abbrev\":\"EFNS, 2011\",\"@Type\":\"Recommendation\",\"ID\":{\"$\":\"20482602\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"}}]}","id":"3762"}

Atypical neuroaxonal dystrophy (atypical NAD). PLA2G6-related dystonia-parkinsonism. INAD usually begins between ages six months and three years with psychomotor regression or delay, hypotonia, and progressive spastic tetraparesis. Many affected children never learn to walk or lose the ability shortly after attaining it. Strabismus, nystagmus, and optic atrophy are common. Disease progression is rapid, resulting in severe spasticity, progressive cognitive decline, and visual impairment. Many affected children do not survive beyond their first decade. Atypical NAD shows more phenotypic variability than INAD. In general, onset is in early childhood but can be as late as the end of the second decade. The presenting signs may be gait instability, ataxia, or speech delay and autistic features, which are sometimes the only evidence of disease for a year or more. Strabismus, nystagmus, and optic atrophy are common. Neuropsychiatric disturbances including impulsivity, poor attention span, hyperactivity, and emotional lability are also common. The course is fairly stable during early childhood and resembles static encephalopathy but is followed by neurologic deterioration between ages seven and 12 years. PLA2G6-related dystonia-parkinsonism has a variable age of onset, but most individuals present in early adulthood with gait disturbance or neuropsychiatric changes. Affected individuals consistently develop dystonia and parkinsonism (which may be accompanied by rapid cognitive decline) in their late teens to early twenties. Dystonia is most common in the hands and feet but may be more generalized.

{"attribute_content":[],"public_definition":"Nemaline myopathy is a disorder that primarily affects skeletal muscles, which are muscles that the body uses for movement. People with nemaline myopathy have muscle weakness (myopathy) throughout the body, but it is typically most severe in the muscles of the face; neck; trunk; and other muscles close to the center of the body (proximal muscles), such as those of the upper arms and legs. This weakness can worsen over time. Affected individuals may have feeding and swallowing difficulties, foot deformities, abnormal curvature of the spine (scoliosis), and joint deformities (contractures). Most people with nemaline myopathy are able to walk, although some affected children may begin walking later than usual. As the condition progresses, some people may require wheelchair assistance. In severe cases, the muscles used for breathing are affected and life-threatening breathing difficulties can occur.Nemaline myopathy is divided into six types. In order of decreasing severity, the types are: severe congenital, Amish, intermediate congenital, typical congenital, childhood-onset, and adult-onset. The types are distinguished by the age when symptoms first appear and the severity of symptoms; however, there is overlap among the various types. The severe congenital type is the most life-threatening. Most individuals with this type do not survive past early childhood due to respiratory failure. The Amish type solely affects the Old Order Amish population of Pennsylvania and is typically fatal in early childhood. The most common type of nemaline myopathy is the typical congenital type, which is characterized by muscle weakness and feeding problems beginning in infancy. Most of these individuals do not have severe breathing problems and can walk unassisted. People with the childhood-onset type usually develop muscle weakness in adolescence. The adult-onset type is the mildest of all the various types.

{"attribute_content":[],"public_definition":"Epidermolysis bullosa simplex (EBS) is characterized by fragility of the skin (and mucosal epithelia in some cases) that results in non-scarring blisters and erosions caused by minor mechanical trauma. The current classification of epidermolysis bullosa (EB) includes two major types and 17 minor subtypes of EBS; all share the common feature of blistering above the dermal-epidermal junction at the ultrastructural level. The four most common subtypes of EBS are the focus of this GeneReview: EBS, localized (EBS-loc; previously known as Weber-Cockayne type). EBS, generalized intermediate (EBS-gen intermed; previously known as Koebner type). EBS-with mottled pigmentation (EBS-MP). EBS, generalized severe (EBS-gen sev; previously known as Dowling-Meara type). The phenotypes for these subtypes range from relatively mild blistering of the hands and feet to more generalized blistering, which can be fatal. In EBS-loc, blisters are rarely present or minimal at birth and may occur on the knees and shins with crawling or on the feet at approximately age 18 months; some individuals manifest the disease in adolescence or early adulthood. Blisters are usually confined to the hands and feet, but can occur anywhere if trauma is significant. In EBS, gen intermed, blisters may be present at birth or develop within the first few months of life. Involvement is more widespread than in EBS-loc, but generally milder than in EBS-gen sev. In EBS-MP, skin fragility is evident at birth and clinically indistinguishable from EBS-gen sev; over time, progressive brown pigmentation interspersed with hypopigmented spots develops on the trunk and extremities, with the pigmentation disappearing in adult life. Focal palmar and plantar hyperkeratoses may occur. In EBS-gen sev, onset is usually at birth; severity varies greatly, both among and within families. Widespread and severe blistering and/or multiple grouped clumps of small blisters are typical and hemorrhagic blisters are common. Improvement occurs during mid- to late childhood. Progressive hyperkeratosis of the palms and soles begins in childhood and may be the major complaint of affected individuals in adult life. Nail dystrophy and milia are common. Both hyper- and hypopigmentation can occur. Mucosal involvement in EBS-gen sev may interfere with feeding, especially in neonates and infants. Blistering can be severe enough to result in neonatal or infant death.","symbol":"PSS2","medgen_id":"C1853354","alternate_names":["Peeling skin syndrome, acral type"],"type":"Disease","alternate_symbols":["APSS"],"xrefs":["{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"609796\",\"type\":\"MIM\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"263534\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Alliance\",\"id\":\"Peeling+skin+syndrome%2C+acral+type/9097\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"Peeling skin syndrome, acral type\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"609796\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_symbols\",\"ref_field_element\":\"APSS\"}","{\"db\":\"GeneReviews\",\"id\":\"NBK1369\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"609796\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"symbol\"}"],"name":"Peeling skin syndrome 2","keywords":[],"content":"{\"Citation\":{\"@Abbrev\":\"GeneReviews\",\"@Type\":\"review\",\"ID\":[{\"$\":\"20301543\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"},{\"$\":\"NBK1369\",\"@Source\":\"BookShelf\"}]}}","id":"3777"}

Primary hyperparathyroidism, the main finding of HPT-JT syndrome, occurs in up to 95% of affected individuals; onset is typically in late adolescence or early adulthood. HPT-JT-associated primary hyperparathyroidism is usually caused by a single parathyroid adenoma. In approximately 10%-15% of individuals, primary hyperparathyroidism is caused by parathyroid carcinoma. Ossifying fibromas of the mandible or maxilla, also known as cementifying fibromas and cemento-ossifying fibromas, occur in 30%-40% of individuals with HPT-JT syndrome. Although benign, these tumors can be locally aggressive and may continue to enlarge if not treated. Approximately 20% of individuals with HPT-JT syndrome have kidney lesions, most commonly cysts; renal hamartomas and (more rarely) Wilms tumor have also been reported. Benign and malignant uterine tumors appear to be common in women with HPT-JT syndrome. Parathyroid carcinoma. Most parathyroid carcinomas are functional, resulting in hyperparathyroidism and a high serum calcium level; however, non-functioning parathyroid carcinomas are also rarely described in individuals with a CDC73-related disorder.

{"attribute_content":[],"public_definition":"Familial thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection (familial TAAD) involves problems with the aorta, which is the large blood vessel that distributes blood from the heart to the rest of the body. Familial TAAD affects the upper part of the aorta, near the heart. This part of the aorta is called the thoracic aorta because it is located in the chest (thorax). Other vessels that carry blood from the heart to the rest of the body (arteries) can also be affected.In familial TAAD, the aorta can become weakened and stretched (aortic dilatation), which can lead to a bulge in the blood vessel wall (an aneurysm). Aortic dilatation may also lead to a sudden tearing of the layers in the aorta wall (aortic dissection), allowing blood to flow abnormally between the layers. These aortic abnormalities are potentially life-threatening because they can decrease blood flow to other parts of the body such as the brain or other vital organs, or cause the aorta to break open (rupture).The occurrence and timing of these aortic abnormalities vary, even within the same affected family. They can begin in childhood or not occur until late in life. Aortic dilatation is generally the first feature of familial TAAD to develop, although in some affected individuals dissection occurs with little or no aortic dilatation.Aortic aneurysms usually have no symptoms. However, depending on the size, growth rate, and location of these abnormalities, they can cause pain in the jaw, neck, chest, or back; swelling in the arms, neck, or head; difficult or painful swallowing; hoarseness; shortness of breath; wheezing; a chronic cough; or coughing up blood. Aortic dissections usually cause severe, sudden chest or back pain, and may also result in unusually pale skin (pallor), a very faint pulse, numbness or tingling (paresthesias) in one or more limbs, or paralysis.Familial TAAD may not be associated with other signs and symptoms. However, some individuals in affected families show mild features of related conditions called Marfan syndrome or Loeys-Dietz syndrome. These features include tall stature, stretch marks on the skin, an unusually large range of joint movement (joint hypermobility), and either a sunken or protruding chest. Occasionally, people with familial TAAD develop aneurysms in the brain or in the section of the aorta located in the abdomen (abdominal aorta). Some people with familial TAAD have heart abnormalities that are present from birth (congenital). Affected individuals may also have a soft out-pouching in the lower abdomen (inguinal hernia), an abnormal curvature of the spine (scoliosis), or a purplish skin discoloration (livedo reticularis) caused by abnormalities in the tiny blood vessels of the skin (dermal capillaries).

{"attribute_content":[],"public_definition":"Age-related macular degeneration is an eye disease that is a leading cause of vision loss in older people in developed countries. Subtle abnormalities indicating changes in vision may occur in a person's forties or fifties. Distorted vision and vision loss usually become noticeable in a person's sixties or seventies and tend to worsen over time.Age-related macular degeneration mainly affects central vision, which is needed for detailed tasks such as reading, driving, and recognizing faces. The vision loss in this condition results from a gradual deterioration of light-sensing cells in the tissue at the back of the eye that detects light and color (the retina). Specifically, age-related macular degeneration affects a small area near the center of the retina, called the macula, which is responsible for central vision. Side (peripheral) vision and night vision are generally not affected, but slow adjustment of vision to darkness (dark adaptation) and reduced dim light (scotopic) vision often occur in the early stages of the disease.Researchers have described two major types of age-related macular degeneration, known as the dry form and the wet form. The dry form is much more common, accounting for 85 to 90 percent of all cases of age-related macular degeneration. It is characterized by a buildup of yellowish deposits called drusen beneath the retina and vision loss that worsens slowly over time. The most advanced stage of dry age-related macular degeneration is known as geographic atrophy, in which areas of the macula waste away (atrophy), resulting in severe vision loss. Dry age-related macular degeneration typically affects vision in both eyes, although vision loss often occurs in one eye before the other.In 10 to 15 percent of affected individuals, the dry form progresses to the wet form of age-related macular degeneration. The wet form is characterized by the growth of abnormal, fragile blood vessels underneath the macula. These vessels leak blood and fluid, which damages the macula and makes central vision appear blurry and distorted. The wet form of age-related macular degeneration is associated with severe vision loss that can worsen rapidly.","symbol":"ARMD4","medgen_id":"C1853147","alternate_names":[],"type":"Disease","alternate_symbols":[],"xrefs":["{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"610698\",\"type\":\"MIM\"}","{\"db\":\"GeneTests\",\"id\":\"290313\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Alliance\",\"id\":\"Age-related+macular+degeneration+4/7654\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"age-related-macular-degeneration\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"610698\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"symbol\"}"],"name":"Age-related macular degeneration 4","keywords":[],"content":"{\"Citation\":{\"@Abbrev\":\"Awh et al., 2013\",\"@Type\":\"Suggested Reading\",\"ID\":{\"$\":\"23972322\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"}}}","id":"2717"}

Xanthomas (patches of yellowish cholesterol buildup) may worsen with age as a result of extremely high cholesterol levels. Xanthomas can occur around the eyelids and within the tendons of the elbows, hands, knees, and feet. In FH, the more common cardiovascular disease is coronary artery disease (CAD), which may manifest as angina and myocardial infarction; stroke occurs more rarely. Untreated men are at a 50% risk for a fatal or nonfatal coronary event by age 50 years; untreated women are at a 30% risk by age 60 years. An estimated 70%-95% of FH results from a heterozygous pathogenic variant in one of three genes (APOB, LDLR, PCSK9). FH is the most common inherited cardiovascular disease, with a prevalence of 1:200-250. FH likely accounts for 2%-3% of myocardial infarctions in individuals younger than age 60 years.

HPT-JT-associated primary hyperparathyroidism is usually caused by a single parathyroid adenoma.

Ossifying fibromas of the mandible or maxilla, also known as cementifying fibromas and cemento-ossifying fibromas, occur in 30%-40% of individuals with HPT-JT syndrome. Although benign, these tumors can be locally aggressive and may continue to enlarge if not treated. Approximately 20% of individuals with HPT-JT syndrome have kidney lesions, most commonly cysts; renal hamartomas and (more rarely) Wilms tumor have also been reported. Benign and malignant uterine tumors appear to be common in women with HPT-JT syndrome. Parathyroid carcinoma.

{"attribute_content":[],"public_definition":"Malignant hyperthermia susceptibility (MHS) is a pharmacogenetic disorder of skeletal muscle calcium regulation associated with uncontrolled skeletal muscle hypermetabolism. Manifestations of malignant hyperthermia (MH) are precipitated by certain volatile anesthetics (i.e., halothane, isoflurane, sevoflurane, desflurane, enflurane), either alone or in conjunction with a depolarizing muscle relaxant (specifically, succinylcholine). The triggering substances cause uncontrolled release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum and may promote entry of extracellular calcium into the myoplasm, causing contracture of skeletal muscles, glycogenolysis, and increased cellular metabolism, resulting in production of heat and excess lactate. Affected individuals experience acidosis, hypercapnia, tachycardia, hyperthermia, muscle rigidity, compartment syndrome, rhabdomyolysis with subsequent increase in serum creatine kinase (CK) concentration, hyperkalemia with a risk for cardiac arrhythmia or even cardiac arrest, and myoglobinuria with a risk for renal failure. In nearly all cases, the first manifestations of MH (tachycardia and tachypnea) occur in the operating room; however, MH may also occur in the early postoperative period.

The three types notwithstanding, clinical presentation and course are highly variable, ranging from infants who die in the first year of life to mildly involved adults. Clinical presentations tend to be similar in sibs. In the infantile multisystem type, infants show axial hypotonia, hyporeflexia, esotropia, and developmental delay. Feeding problems, vomiting, failure to thrive, and impaired growth are frequently seen. Subcutaneous fat may be excessive over the buttocks and suprapubic region. Two distinct clinical presentations are observed: (1) a non-fatal neurologic form with strabismus, psychomotor retardation, and cerebellar hypoplasia in infancy followed by neuropathy and retinitis pigmentosa in the first or second decade and (2) a neurologic-multivisceral form with approximately 20% mortality in the first year of life. The late-infantile and childhood ataxia-intellectual disability type, with onset between age three and ten years, is characterized by hypotonia, ataxia, severely delayed language and motor development, inability to walk, and IQ of 40 to 70; other findings include seizures, stroke-like episodes or transient unilateral loss of function, retinitis pigmentosa, joint contractures, and skeletal deformities.

{"attribute_content":[],"public_definition":"Lung cancer is a disease in which certain cells in the lungs become abnormal and multiply uncontrollably to form a tumor. Lung cancer may not cause signs or symptoms in its early stages. Some people with lung cancer have chest pain, frequent coughing, blood in the mucus, breathing problems, trouble swallowing or speaking, loss of appetite and weight loss, fatigue, or swelling in the face or neck. Additional symptoms can develop if the cancer spreads (metastasizes) into other tissues. Lung cancer occurs most often in adults in their sixties or seventies. Most people who develop lung cancer have a history of long-term tobacco smoking; however, the condition can occur in people who have never smoked.Lung cancer is generally divided into two types, small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer, based on the size of the affected cells when viewed under a microscope. Non-small cell lung cancer accounts for 85 percent of lung cancer, while small cell lung cancer accounts for the remaining 15 percent.Small cell lung cancer grows quickly and in more than half of cases the cancer has spread beyond the lung by the time the condition is diagnosed. Small cell lung cancer often metastasizes, most commonly to the liver, brain, bones, and adrenal glands (small hormone-producing glands located on top of each kidney). After diagnosis, most people with small cell lung cancer survive for about 1 year; less than seven percent survive 5 years.Non-small cell lung cancer is divided into three main subtypes: adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and large cell lung carcinoma. Adenocarcinoma arises from the cells that line the small air sacs (alveoli) located throughout the lungs. Squamous cell carcinoma arises from squamous cells that line the passages leading from the windpipe (trachea) to the lungs (bronchi). Large cell carcinoma arises from epithelial cells that line the lungs. Large cell carcinoma encompasses non-small cell lung cancers that do not appear to be adenocarcinomas or squamous cell carcinomas. The 5-year survival rate for people with non-small cell lung cancer is usually between 11 and 17 percent; it can be lower or higher depending on the subtype and stage of the cancer.","symbol":"NSCLC","medgen_id":"C0007131","alternate_names":["Non-small cell lung carcinoma"],"type":"Disease","alternate_symbols":[],"xrefs":["{\"db\":\"Human Phenotype Ontology\",\"id\":\"HP:0030358\",\"type\":\"primary\"}","{\"db\":\"MeSH\",\"id\":\"D002289\"}","{\"db\":\"Human Phenotype Ontology\",\"id\":\"HP:0030358\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"Non-small cell lung carcinoma\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000569448\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000569877\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000569888\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000569891\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Alliance\",\"id\":\"Non-small+cell+lung+cancer/5250\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Human Phenotype Ontology\",\"id\":\"HP:0030358\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Office of Rare Diseases\",\"id\":\"7217\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"SNOMED CT\",\"id\":\"254637007\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"lung-cancer\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}","{\"db\":\"Office of Rare Diseases\",\"id\":\"7217\",\"ref_field\":\"symbol\"}"],"name":"Non-small cell lung cancer","keywords":[],"content":"{\"Citation\":[{\"@Abbrev\":\"FDA, 2014\",\"@Type\":\"practice guideline\",\"ID\":{\"$\":\"24868098\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"}},{\"@Abbrev\":\"Cooper et al., 2014\",\"@Type\":\"Suggested Reading\",\"ID\":{\"$\":\"24673736\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"}},{\"@Abbrev\":\"KCPSG, 2014\",\"@Type\":\"practice guideline\",\"ID\":{\"$\":\"24627688\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"}},{\"@Abbrev\":\"KCPSG, 2013\",\"@Type\":\"Recommendation\",\"ID\":{\"$\":\"23667368\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"}},{\"@Abbrev\":\"NICE, 2013\",\"@Type\":\"practice guideline\",\"URL\":{\"$\":\"https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/dg9\"}},{\"@Abbrev\":\"AHRQ, 2013\",\"@Type\":\"practice guideline\",\"CitationText\":{\"$\":\"Technology Assessment on Genetic Testing or Molecular Pathology Testing of Cancers with Unknown Primary Site to Determine Origin\"},\"URL\":{\"$\":\"https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Coverage/DeterminationProcess/downloads/id90TA.pdf\"}}]}","disease_mechanism":"Other","disease_mechanism_id":"283","id":"7728"}

{"attribute_content":[],"public_definition":"Breast cancer is a disease in which certain cells in the breast become abnormal and multiply uncontrollably to form a tumor. Although breast cancer is much more common in women, this form of cancer can also develop in men. In both women and men, the most common form of breast cancer begins in cells lining the milk ducts (ductal cancer). In women, cancer can also develop in the glands that produce milk (lobular cancer). Most men have little or no lobular tissue, so lobular cancer in men is very rare.In its early stages, breast cancer usually does not cause pain and may exhibit no noticeable symptoms. As the cancer progresses, signs and symptoms can include a lump or thickening in or near the breast; a change in the size or shape of the breast; nipple discharge, tenderness, or retraction (turning inward); and skin irritation, dimpling, or scaliness. However, these changes can occur as part of many different conditions. Having one or more of these symptoms does not mean that a person definitely has breast cancer.In some cases, cancerous tumors can invade surrounding tissue and spread to other parts of the body. If breast cancer spreads, cancerous cells most often appear in the bones, liver, lungs, or brain.

{"attribute_content":[],"public_definition":"Breast cancer is a disease in which certain cells in the breast become abnormal and multiply uncontrollably to form a tumor. Although breast cancer is much more common in women, this form of cancer can also develop in men. In both women and men, the most common form of breast cancer begins in cells lining the milk ducts (ductal cancer). In women, cancer can also develop in the glands that produce milk (lobular cancer). Most men have little or no lobular tissue, so lobular cancer in men is very rare.In its early stages, breast cancer usually does not cause pain and may exhibit no noticeable symptoms. As the cancer progresses, signs and symptoms can include a lump or thickening in or near the breast; a change in the size or shape of the breast; nipple discharge, tenderness, or retraction (turning inward); and skin irritation, dimpling, or scaliness. However, these changes can occur as part of many different conditions. Having one or more of these symptoms does not mean that a person definitely has breast cancer.In some cases, cancerous tumors can invade surrounding tissue and spread to other parts of the body. If breast cancer spreads, cancerous cells most often appear in the bones, liver, lungs, or brain. Tumors that begin at one site and then spread to other areas of the body are called metastatic cancers.A small percentage of all breast cancers cluster in families. These cancers are described as hereditary and are associated with inherited gene mutations.

{"attribute_content":[],"public_definition":"Acid sphingomyelinase (ASM) deficiency has been categorized in the past as either neuronopathic (Niemann-Pick disease type A [NPD-A]), with death in early childhood, or non-neuronopathic (Niemann-Pick disease type B [NPD-B]). While forms intermediate to these two extremes occur, all ASM deficiency that is not NPD-A is designated in this review as NPD-B, despite its wide range of manifestations and severity. The first symptom in NPD-A is hepatosplenomegaly, usually noted by age three months; over time the liver and spleen become massive. Psychomotor development progresses no further than the 12-month level, after which neurologic deterioration is relentless. A classic cherry-red spot of the macula of the retina, which may not be present in the first few months, is eventually present in all affected children. Interstitial lung disease caused by storage of sphingomyelin in pulmonary macrophages results in frequent respiratory infections and often respiratory failure. Most children succumb before the third year. NPD type B, later in onset and milder in manifestations than NPD type A, is characterized by hepatosplenomegaly with progressive hypersplenism and stable liver dysfunction, gradual deterioration in pulmonary function, osteopenia, and atherogenic lipid profile. Progressive and/or clinically significant neurologic manifestations occur infrequently. Survival to adulthood can occur.","medgen_id":"C0268242","alternate_names":["SPHINGOMYELIN LIPIDOSIS","SPHINGOMYELINASE DEFICIENCY"],"type":"Disease","alternate_symbols":[],"xrefs":["{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"257200\",\"type\":\"MIM\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"77292\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"257200\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"SPHINGOMYELIN LIPIDOSIS\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"257200\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"SPHINGOMYELINASE DEFICIENCY\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000051492\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000246735\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000330870\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000501745\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000501749\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000506506\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000507864\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000522527\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000528634\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000551442\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000556495\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000556506\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000556507\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000556508\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000556520\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000558532\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000569406\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000569442\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000569983\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000570010\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000570054\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Alliance\",\"id\":\"Niemann-Pick+Disease%2C+Type+A/5226\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"SNOMED CT\",\"id\":\"52165006\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"GeneReviews\",\"id\":\"NBK1370\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}"],"name":"Niemann-Pick disease, type A","keywords":[],"content":"{\"Citation\":[{\"@Abbrev\":\"GeneReviews\",\"@Type\":\"review\",\"ID\":[{\"$\":\"20301544\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"},{\"$\":\"NBK1370\",\"@Source\":\"BookShelf\"}]},{\"@Abbrev\":\"ACMG, 2008\",\"@Type\":\"practice guideline\",\"ID\":{\"$\":\"18197057\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"}},{\"@Abbrev\":\"ACOG, 2009\",\"@Type\":\"practice guideline\",\"ID\":{\"$\":\"19888064\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"}}]}","disease_mechanism":"loss of function","disease_mechanism_id":"273","id":"5650"}

{"attribute_content":[],"public_definition":"CLN2 disease is an inherited disorder that primarily affects the nervous system. The signs and symptoms of this condition typically begin between ages 2 and 4. The initial features usually include recurrent seizures (epilepsy) and difficulty coordinating movements (ataxia). Affected children also develop muscle twitches (myoclonus) and vision loss. CLN2 disease affects motor skills, such as sitting and walking, and speech development. This condition also causes the loss of previously acquired skills (developmental regression), intellectual disability that gradually gets worse, and behavioral problems. Individuals with this condition often require the use of a wheelchair by late childhood and typically do not survive past their teens.Some children with CLN2 disease do not develop symptoms until later in childhood, typically after age 4. These individuals tend to have milder features overall compared to those diagnosed earlier, but with more severe ataxia. They have a shortened life expectancy, although they tend to survive into adulthood.CLN2 disease is one of a group of disorders known as neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs), which may also be collectively referred to as Batten disease. All these disorders affect the nervous system and typically cause worsening problems with vision, movement, and thinking ability. The different NCLs are distinguished by their genetic cause. Each disease type is given the designation \"CLN,\" meaning ceroid lipofuscinosis, neuronal, and then a number to indicate its subtype.","medgen_id":"C0027877","alternate_names":[],"type":"Disease","alternate_symbols":[],"xrefs":["{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"214200\",\"type\":\"MIM\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"PS256730\",\"type\":\"Phenotypic series\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"216\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"79263\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000500216\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000509415\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000509416\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000509800\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000520979\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000520995\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000520996\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000520997\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000551442\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000561937\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Alliance\",\"id\":\"Neuronal+Ceroid+Lipofuscinosis/5192\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"SNOMED CT\",\"id\":\"42012007\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"cln2-disease\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}"],"name":"Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis","keywords":[],"content":"{\"Citation\":[{\"@Type\":\"review\",\"ID\":{\"$\":\"19084560\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"}},{\"@Abbrev\":\"GeneReviews\",\"@Type\":\"review\",\"ID\":[{\"$\":\"20301601\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"},{\"$\":\"NBK1428\",\"@Source\":\"BookShelf\"}]}]}","disease_mechanism":"loss of function","disease_mechanism_id":"273","id":"1409"}

{"attribute_content":[],"public_definition":"APC-associated polyposis conditions include: familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), attenuated FAP, and gastric adenocarcinoma and proximal polyposis of the stomach (GAPPS). FAP is a colon cancer predisposition syndrome in which hundreds to thousands of adenomatous colonic polyps develop, beginning, on average, at age 16 years (range 7-36 years). By age 35 years, 95% of individuals with FAP have polyps; without colectomy, colon cancer is inevitable. The mean age of colon cancer diagnosis in untreated individuals is 39 years (range 34-43 years). Extracolonic manifestations are variably present and include: polyps of the gastric fundus and duodenum, osteomas, dental anomalies, congenital hypertrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium (CHRPE), soft tissue tumors, desmoid tumors, and associated cancers. Attenuated FAP is characterized by multiple colonic polyps (average of 30), more proximally located polyps, and a diagnosis of colon cancer at a later age than in FAP. Certain extracolonic manifestations, such as gastric and duodenal polyps or cancers, are variably present in attenuated FAP; risk management may be substantially different between FAP and attenuated FAP. GAPPS is characterized by gastric fundic gland polyposis, increased risk of gastric cancer, and limited colonic involvement in most individuals reported.","symbol":"FAP1","medgen_id":"C2713442","alternate_names":["APC-Associated Polyposis Conditions","FAMILIAL ADENOMATOUS POLYPOSIS 1, ATTENUATED","Familial Adenomatous Polyposis","POLYPOSIS,

Before the genetic basis of SMA was understood, it was classified into clinical subtypes based on maximum motor function achieved; however, it is now apparent that the phenotype of SMN1-associated SMA spans a continuum without clear delineation of subtypes. With supportive care only, poor weight gain with growth failure, restrictive lung disease, scoliosis, and joint contractures are common complications; however, newly available targeted treatment

The most common clinical manifestation is spontaneous and recurrent nosebleeds (epistaxis) beginning on average at age 12 years. Telangiectases (small AVMs) are most evident on the lips, tongue, buccal mucosa, face, chest, and fingers. The average age of onset is generally later than epistaxis, but may be during childhood. Large AVMs often cause symptoms when they occur in the lungs, liver, or brain; complications from bleeding or shunting may be sudden and catastrophic. Approximately 25% of individuals with HHT have GI bleeding, which most commonly begins after age 50 years.","symbol":"HHT1","medgen_id":"C4551861","alternate_names":["Osler Weber Rendu syndrome type 1"],"type":"Disease","alternate_symbols":["ORW1"],"xrefs":["{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"187300\",\"type\":\"MIM\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"774\"}","{\"db\":\"Office of Rare Diseases\",\"id\":\"6626\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"Osler Weber Rendu syndrome type 1\"}","{\"db\":\"Office of Rare Diseases\",\"id\":\"6626\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_symbols\",\"ref_field_element\":\"ORW1\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000227625\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000500544\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000500545\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000505110\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000506220\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000506221\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000506222\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000509787\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000509788\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000511259\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000512361\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000515716\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000515719\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000528531\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000528884\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000553700\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000558916\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000562015\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Office of Rare Diseases\",\"id\":\"6626\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"GeneReviews\",\"id\":\"NBK1351\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"187300\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"symbol\"}","{\"db\":\"Office of Rare Diseases\",\"id\":\"6626\",\"ref_field\":\"symbol\"}"],"name":"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia type 1","keywords":[],"content":"{\"Citation\":[{\"@Abbrev\":\"GeneReviews\",\"@Type\":\"review\",\"ID\":[{\"$\":\"20301525\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"},{\"$\":\"NBK1351\",\"@Source\":\"BookShelf\"}]},{\"@Abbrev\":\"HHT Foundation Int'l, 2011\",\"@Type\":\"practice guideline\",\"ID\":{\"$\":\"19553198\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"}},{\"@Abbrev\":\"Shovlin et al., 2000\",\"@Type\":\"Suggested Reading\",\"ID\":{\"$\":\"10751092\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"}}]}","disease_mechanism":"loss of function","disease_mechanism_id":"273","id":"16695"}

Individuals with thalassemia major have severe anemia and hepatosplenomegaly; they usually come to medical attention within the first two years of life.

Treatment with a regular transfusion program and chelation therapy, aimed at reducing transfusion iron overload, allows for normal growth and development and may improve the overall prognosis. Individuals with thalassemia intermedia present later and have milder anemia that does not require regular treatment with blood transfusion.

{"attribute_content":[],"public_definition":"Acid sphingomyelinase (ASM) deficiency has been categorized in the past as either neuronopathic (Niemann-Pick disease type A [NPD-A]), with death in early childhood, or non-neuronopathic (Niemann-Pick disease type B [NPD-B]). While forms intermediate to these two extremes occur, all ASM deficiency that is not NPD-A is designated in this review as NPD-B, despite its wide range of manifestations and severity. The first symptom in NPD-A is hepatosplenomegaly, usually noted by age three months; over time the liver and spleen become massive. Psychomotor development progresses no further than the 12-month level, after which neurologic deterioration is relentless. A classic cherry-red spot of the macula of the retina, which may not be present in the first few months, is eventually present in all affected children. Interstitial lung disease caused by storage of sphingomyelin in pulmonary macrophages results in frequent respiratory infections and often respiratory failure. Most children succumb before the third year. NPD type B, later in onset and milder in manifestations than NPD type A, is characterized by hepatosplenomegaly with progressive hypersplenism and stable liver dysfunction, gradual deterioration in pulmonary function, osteopenia, and atherogenic lipid profile. Progressive and/or clinically significant neurologic manifestations occur infrequently. Survival to adulthood can occur.","medgen_id":"C0268243","alternate_names":[],"type":"Disease","alternate_symbols":[],"xrefs":["{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"607616\",\"type\":\"MIM\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"77293\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000051492\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000246735\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000330870\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000501745\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000501749\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000522527\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000528634\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000556495\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000556506\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000556507\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000556508\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000556520\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000558532\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000570054\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Alliance\",\"id\":\"Niemann-Pick+Disease%2C+Type+B/5227\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"SNOMED CT\",\"id\":\"39390005\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"GeneReviews\",\"id\":\"NBK1370\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}"],"name":"Niemann-Pick disease, type B","keywords":[],"content":"{\"Citation\":{\"@Abbrev\":\"GeneReviews\",\"@Type\":\"review\",\"ID\":[{\"$\":\"20301544\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"},{\"$\":\"NBK1370\",\"@Source\":\"BookShelf\"}]}}","disease_mechanism":"loss of function","disease_mechanism_id":"273","id":"3636"}

They are used to treat a variety of immunological disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, non- Hodgkin lymphoma and ulcerative colitis. Both mercaptopurine and thioguanine can exert cytotoxic effects through the formation of thioguanine nucleotides (TGNs), active metabolites that incorporate into DNA. Mercaptopurine and thioguanine are directly inactivated by thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT). Individuals with two nonfunctional TPMT alleles are at 100% risk of potentially fatal myelosuppression, due to an increased buildup of toxic TGNs. Alternative agents or a drastically reduced dose are recommended for patients with this genotype. Patients heterozygous for a nonfunctional TPMT allele are at increased risk of myelosuppression, and reduced dosing is recommended for these individuals. These dosing guidelines have been published in Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics by the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) and are available on the PharmGKB website.","symbol":"THPM1","medgen_id":"C0342801","alternate_names":["THIOPURINE S-METHYLTRANSFERASE DEFICIENCY","THIOPURINES, POOR METABOLISM OF, 1","TPMT deficiency"],"type":"Disease","alternate_symbols":["TPMT","TPMTD"],"xrefs":["{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"610460\",\"type\":\"MIM\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"610460\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"THIOPURINE S-METHYLTRANSFERASE DEFICIENCY\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"187680.0001\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"THIOPURINES, POOR METABOLISM OF, 1\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"187680.0002\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"THIOPURINES, POOR METABOLISM OF, 1\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"187680.0003\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"THIOPURINES, POOR METABOLISM OF, 1\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"187680.0004\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"THIOPURINES, POOR METABOLISM OF, 1\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"187680.0005\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"THIOPURINES, POOR METABOLISM OF, 1\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"187680.0006\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"THIOPURINES, POOR METABOLISM OF, 1\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"187680.0007\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"THIOPURINES, POOR METABOLISM OF, 1\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"610460\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"THIOPURINES, POOR METABOLISM OF, 1\"}","{\"db\":\"Office of Rare Diseases\",\"id\":\"9153\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_symbols\",\"ref_field_element\":\"TPMT\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"610460\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_symbols\",\"ref_field_element\":\"TPMTD\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000299976\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000502252\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000509706\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000522313\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000522314\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000553222\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Alliance\",\"id\":\"Thiopurine+S+methyltranferase+deficiency/54\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Office of Rare Diseases\",\"id\":\"5173\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"SNOMED CT\",\"id\":\"238012003\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"PharmGKB\",\"id\":\"PA356\",\"type\":\"drug\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"610460\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"symbol\"}"],"name":"Thiopurine methyltransferase deficiency","keywords":[],"content":"{\"Citation\":[{\"@Abbrev\":\"CPIC, 2011\",\"@Type\":\"practice guideline\",\"ID\":{\"$\":\"3098761\",\"@Source\":\"pmc\"}},{\"@Abbrev\":\"PLoS Currents, 2011\",\"@Type\":\"practice guideline\",\"ID\":{\"$\":\"3094768\",\"@Source\":\"pmc\"}},{\"@Abbrev\":\"CPIC, 2013\",\"@Type\":\"practice guideline\",\"ID\":{\"$\":\"3604643\",\"@Source\":\"pmc\"}}]}","disease_mechanism":"loss of function","disease_mechanism_id":"273","id":"4543"}

CS is a multiple hamartoma syndrome with a high risk for benign and malignant tumors of the thyroid, breast, and endometrium. Affected individuals usually have macrocephaly, trichilemmomas, and papillomatous papules, and present by the late 20s. The lifetime risk of developing breast cancer is 85%, with an average age of diagnosis between 38 and 46 years. The lifetime risk for thyroid cancer (usually follicular, rarely papillary, but never medullary thyroid cancer) is approximately 35%. The risk for endometrial cancer may approach 28%. BRRS is a congenital disorder characterized by macrocephaly, intestinal hamartomatous polyposis, lipomas, and pigmented macules of the glans penis. PS is a complex, highly variable disorder involving congenital malformations and hamartomatous overgrowth of multiple tissues, as well as connective tissue nevi, epidermal nevi, and hyperostoses. Proteus-like syndrome is undefined but refers to individuals with significant clinical features of PS who do not meet the diagnostic criteria for PS.","symbol":"PHTS","medgen_id":"C1959582","alternate_names":["PTEN Hamartomatous Tumour Syndrome"],"type":"Disease","alternate_symbols":[],"xrefs":["{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"601728\",\"type\":\"MIM\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"306498\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000326160\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000551654\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000552184\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000552245\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000552302\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000552440\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000558503\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000558905\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000570011\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"GeneReviews\",\"id\":\"NBK1488\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}"],"name":"PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome","keywords":["Hereditary cancer syndrome","Neoplasm"],"content":"{\"Citation\":[{\"@Abbrev\":\"GeneReviews\",\"@Type\":\"review\",\"ID\":[{\"$\":\"20301661\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"},{\"$\":\"NBK1488\",\"@Source\":\"BookShelf\"}]},{\"@Abbrev\":\"ACS, 2007\",\"@Type\":\"practice guideline\",\"ID\":{\"$\":\"17392385\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"}},{\"@Abbrev\":\"ACMG, 2013\",\"@Type\":\"Recommendation\",\"ID\":{\"$\":\"23788249\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"}},{\"@Abbrev\":\"ACMG, 2013\",\"@Type\":\"practice guideline\",\"ID\":{\"$\":\"23519317\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"}},{\"@Abbrev\":\"NCCN, 2014\",\"@Type\":\"practice guideline\",\"ID\":{\"$\":\"25190698\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"}},{\"@Abbrev\":\"ACG, 2015\",\"@Type\":\"practice guideline\",\"ID\":{\"$\":\"25645574\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"}},{\"@Abbrev\":\"ACMG, 2015\",\"@Type\":\"Recommendation\",\"ID\":{\"$\":\"25356965\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"}},{\"@Abbrev\":\"ACMG, 2016\",\"@Type\":\"Recommendation\",\"ID\":[{\"$\":\"27854360\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"},{\"$\":\"10.1038/gim.2016.190\",\"@Source\":\"DOI\"}]}]}","disease_mechanism":"loss of function","disease_mechanism_id":"273","id":"10363"}

{"attribute_content":[],"public_definition":"FMR1 disorders include fragile X syndrome (FXS), fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS), and fragile X-associated primary ovarian insufficiency (FXPOI). Fragile X syndrome occurs in individuals with an FMR1 full mutation or other loss-of-function variant and is nearly always characterized in affected males by developmental delay and intellectual disability along with a variety of behavioral issues. Autism spectrum disorder is present in 50%-70% of individuals with FXS. Affected males may have characteristic craniofacial features (which become more obvious with age) and medical problems including hypotonia, gastroesophageal reflux, strabismus, seizures, sleep disorders, joint laxity, pes planus, scoliosis, and recurrent otitis media. Adults may have mitral valve prolapse or aortic root dilatation. The physical and behavioral features seen in males with FXS have been reported in females heterozygous for the FMR1 full mutation, but with lower frequency and milder involvement. FXTAS occurs in individuals who have an FMR1 premutation and is characterized by late-onset, progressive cerebellar ataxia and intention tremor followed by cognitive impairment. Psychiatric disorders are common. Age of onset is typically between 60 and 65 years and is more common among males who are hemizygous for the premutation (40%) than among females who are heterozygous for the premutation (16%-20%). FXPOI, defined as hypergonadotropic hypogonadism before age 40 years, has been observed in 20% of women who carry a premutation allele compared to 1% in the general population.","symbol":"FXS","medgen_id":"C0016667","alternate_names":["FRAGILE X MENTAL RETARDATION SYNDROME","Fragile X syndrome, type A","MENTAL RETARDATION, X-LINKED, ASSOCIATED WITH marXq28"],"type":"Disease","alternate_symbols":[],"xrefs":["{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"300624\",\"type\":\"MIM\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"449291\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"908\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"300624\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"FRAGILE X MENTAL RETARDATION SYNDROME\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"300624\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"MENTAL RETARDATION, X-LINKED, ASSOCIATED WITH marXq28\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000264966\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000552393\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000553203\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000556541\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000558914\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000560955\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000561923\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000568029\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000568236\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000568277\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000569426\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000569960\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000570010\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Alliance\",\"id\":\"Fragile+X+Syndrome/2906\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Office of Rare Diseases\",\"id\":\"6464\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"SNOMED CT\",\"id\":\"613003\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"GeneReviews\",\"id\":\"NBK1384\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"300624\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"symbol\"}","{\"db\":\"Office of Rare Diseases\",\"id\":\"6464\",\"ref_field\":\"symbol\"}"],"name":"Fragile X syndrome","keywords":[],"content":"{\"Citation\":[{\"@Type\":\"practice guideline\",\"ID\":{\"$\":\"22797890\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"}},{\"@Abbrev\":\"GeneReviews\",\"@Type\":\"review\",\"ID\":[{\"$\":\"20301558\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"},{\"$\":\"NBK1384\",\"@Source\":\"BookShelf\"}]},{\"@Abbrev\":\"ACMG, 2001\",\"@Type\":\"practice guideline\",\"ID\":{\"$\":\"3110344\",\"@Source\":\"pmc\"}},{\"@Abbrev\":\"ACMG, 2008\",\"@Type\":\"practice guideline\",\"ID\":{\"$\":\"3111012\",\"@Source\":\"pmc\"}},{\"@Abbrev\":\"ACMG, 2005\",\"@Type\":\"practice guideline\",\"ID\":{\"$\":\"3110946\",\"@Source\":\"pmc\"}},{\"@Abbrev\":\"ACMG, 2008\",\"@Type\":\"practice guideline\",\"ID\":{\"$\":\"3111547\",\"@Source\":\"pmc\"}},{\"@Abbrev\":\"EuroGenetest, 2011\",\"@Type\":\"Translational/Evidence-based\",\"ID\":{\"$\":\"21540884\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"}},{\"@Abbrev\":\"ACMG, 2013\",\"@Type\":\"practice guideline\",\"ID\":{\"$\":\"23519317\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"}},{\"@Abbrev\":\"EMQN, 2015\",\"@Type\":\"practice guideline\",\"ID\":{\"$\":\"25227148\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"}},{\"@Abbrev\":\"ACMG, 2013\",\"@Type\":\"practice guideline\",\"ID\":{\"$\":\"23765048\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"}}]}","disease_mechanism":"loss of function","disease_mechanism_id":"273","id":"1302"}
{"attribute_content":[],"public_definition":"RPE65-related Leber congenital amaurosis / early-onset severe retinal dystrophy (RPE65-LCA/EOSRD) is a severe inherited retinal degeneration (IRD) with a typical presentation between birth and age five years. While central vision varies, the hallmark of this disorder is the presence of severe visual impairment with a deceptively preserved retinal structure. Vision is relatively stable in the first decade of life, but begins to decline in adolescence.

{"attribute_content":[],"public_definition":"ELANE-related neutropenia includes congenital neutropenia and cyclic neutropenia, both of which are primary hematologic disorders characterized by recurrent fever, skin and oropharyngeal inflammation (i.e., mouth ulcers, gingivitis, sinusitis, and pharyngitis), and cervical adenopathy. Infectious complications are generally more severe in congenital neutropenia than in cyclic neutropenia. In congenital neutropenia, omphalitis immediately after birth may be the first sign; in untreated children diarrhea, pneumonia, and deep abscesses in the liver, lungs, and subcutaneous tissues are common in the first year of life. After 15 years with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor treatment, the risk of developing myelodysplasia (MDS) or acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) is approximately 15%-25%. Cyclic neutropenia is usually diagnosed within the first year of life based on approximately three-week intervals of fever and oral ulcerations and regular oscillations of blood cell counts. Cellulitis, especially perianal cellulitis, is common during neutropenic periods. Between neutropenic periods, affected individuals are generally healthy. Symptoms improve in adulthood. Cyclic neutropenia is not associated with risk of malignancy or conversion to leukemia.","medgen_id":"C0221023","alternate_names":[],"type":"Disease","alternate_symbols":[],"xrefs":["{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"162800\",\"type\":\"MIM\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"2686\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000500009\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000521914\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000528303\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000529138\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000530631\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000552055\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000561788\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Alliance\",\"id\":\"Cyclic+Hematopoiesis/2064\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"SNOMED CT\",\"id\":\"191347008\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"GeneReviews\",\"id\":\"NBK1533\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}"],"name":"Cyclical neutropenia","keywords":[],"content":"{\"Citation\":{\"@Abbrev\":\"GeneReviews\",\"@Type\":\"review\",\"ID\":[{\"$\":\"20301705\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"},{\"$\":\"NBK1533\",\"@Source\":\"BookShelf\"}]}}","disease_mechanism":"loss of function","disease_mechanism_id":"273","id":"1694"}

Multiple types of clinical seizures have been reported in individuals with pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy. Dramatic presentations consisting of prolonged seizures and recurrent episodes of status epilepticus are typical; recurrent self-limited events including partial seizures, generalized seizures, atonic seizures, myoclonic events, and infantile spasms also occur. Affected individuals may have electrographic seizures without clinical correlates. Infants with the classic neonatal presentation begin to experience seizures soon after birth. Atypical features include: late-onset seizures (seizures that begin from late infancy up until age 3 years); seizures that initially respond to antiepileptic drugs and then become intractable; seizures during early life that do not respond to pyridoxine but are then controlled with pyridoxine several months later; and prolonged seizure-free intervals (≤5.5 months) that occur after discontinuation of pyridoxine. Intellectual disability is common. Elevated concentration of α-aminoadipic semialdehyde (α-AASA) in urine and plasma is a strong biomarker of the disorder; pipecolic acid may also be elevated in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid.","symbol":"EPD","medgen_id":"C1849508","alternate_names":["Pyridoxine-Dependent Seizures"],"type":"Disease","alternate_symbols":["ALDH7A1 deficiency","PDE"],"xrefs":["{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"266100\",\"type\":\"MIM\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"3006\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000328761\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_symbols\",\"ref_field_element\":\"ALDH7A1 deficiency\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"266100\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_symbols\",\"ref_field_element\":\"PDE\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000318883\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000500153\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000509482\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000515787\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000520979\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000520980\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000520995\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000551668\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Alliance\",\"id\":\"Pyridoxine-dependent+epilepsy/6116\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Office of Rare Diseases\",\"id\":\"9298\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"GeneReviews\",\"id\":\"NBK1486\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"266100\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"symbol\"}"],"name":"Pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy","keywords":[],"content":"{\"Citation\":{\"@Abbrev\":\"GeneReviews\",\"@Type\":\"review\",\"ID\":[{\"$\":\"20301659\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"},{\"$\":\"NBK1486\",\"@Source\":\"BookShelf\"}]}}","disease_mechanism":"loss of function","disease_mechanism_id":"273","id":"1615"}

{"attribute_content":[],"public_definition":"Multiminicore disease is a disorder that primarily affects muscles used for movement (skeletal muscles). This condition causes muscle weakness and related health problems that range from mild to life-threatening.Researchers have identified at least four forms of multiminicore disease, which can be distinguished by their characteristic signs and symptoms. The most common form, called the classic form, causes muscle weakness beginning in infancy or early childhood. This weakness is most noticeable in muscles of the trunk and neck (axial muscles) and is less severe in the arm and leg muscles. Muscle weakness causes affected infants to appear \"floppy\" (hypotonic) and can delay the development of motor skills such as sitting, standing, and walking. The disease causes muscles of the ribcage and spine to stiffen. When combined with weakness of the muscles needed for breathing, this stiffness leads to severe or life-threatening respiratory problems. Almost all children with multiminicore disease develop an abnormal curvature of the spine (scoliosis), which appears during childhood and steadily worsens over time.Other forms of multiminicore disease have different patterns of signs and symptoms. They are less common than the classic form, together accounting for about 25 percent of all cases. The atypical forms of the condition tend to be milder and cause few or no problems with breathing. The moderate form with hand involvement causes muscle weakness and looseness of the joints, particularly in the arms and hands. Another form of multiminicore disease, known as the antenatal form with arthrogryposis, is characterized by stiff, rigid joints throughout the body (arthrogryposis), distinctive facial features, and other birth defects. Paralysis of the eye muscles (external ophthalmoplegia) is a primary feature of another atypical form of multiminicore disease. This form of the condition also causes general muscle weakness and feeding difficulties that appear in the first year of life.Many people with multiminicore disease also have an increased risk of a developing a severe reaction to certain drugs used during surgery and other invasive procedures. This reaction is called malignant hyperthermia. Malignant hyperthermia occurs in response to some anesthetic gases, which are used to block the sensation of pain, and with a particular type of muscle relaxant. If given these drugs, people at risk for malignant hyperthermia may experience muscle rigidity, breakdown of muscle fibers (rhabdomyolysis), a high fever, increased acid levels in the blood and other tissues (acidosis), and a rapid heart rate. The complications of malignant hyperthermia can be life-threatening unless they are treated promptly.Multiminicore disease gets its name from small, disorganized areas called minicores, which are found in muscle fibers of many affected individuals.

{"attribute_content":[],"public_definition":"Dyserythropoietic anemia and thrombocytopenia is a condition that affects blood cells and primarily occurs in males. A main feature of this condition is a type of anemia called dyserythropoietic anemia, which is characterized by a shortage of red blood cells. The term \"dyserythropoietic\" refers to the abnormal red blood cell formation that occurs in this condition. In affected individuals, immature red blood cells are unusually shaped and cannot develop into functional mature cells, leading to a shortage of healthy red blood cells. People with dyserythropoietic anemia and thrombocytopenia can have another blood disorder characterized by a reduced level of circulating platelets (thrombocytopenia). Platelets are cells that normally assist with blood clotting. Thrombocytopenia can cause easy bruising and abnormal bleeding. While people with dyserythropoietic anemia and thrombocytopenia can have signs and symptoms of both blood disorders, some are primarily affected by anemia, while others are more affected by thrombocytopenia.The most severe cases of dyserythropoietic anemia and thrombocytopenia are characterized by hydrops fetalis, a condition in which excess fluid builds up in the body before birth. For many others, the signs and symptoms of dyserythropoietic anemia and thrombocytopenia begin in infancy. People with this condition experience prolonged bleeding or bruising after minor trauma or even in the absence of injury (spontaneous bleeding). Anemia can cause pale skin, weakness, and fatigue. Severe anemia may create a need for frequent blood transfusions to replenish the supply of red blood cells; however, repeated blood transfusions over many years can cause health problems such as excess iron in the blood. People with dyserythropoietic anemia and thrombocytopenia may also have a shortage of white blood cells (neutropenia), which can make them prone to recurrent infections. Additionally, they may have an enlarged spleen (splenomegaly). The severity of these abnormalities varies among affected individuals.Some people with dyserythropoietic anemia and thrombocytopenia have additional blood disorders such as beta thalassemia or congenital erythropoietic porphyria. Beta thalassemia is a condition that reduces the production of hemoglobin, which is the iron-containing protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen. A decrease in hemoglobin can lead to a shortage of oxygen in cells and tissues throughout the body. Congenital erythropoietic porphyria is another disorder that impairs hemoglobin production. People with congenital erythropoietic porphyria are also very sensitive to sunlight, and areas of skin exposed to the sun can become fragile and blistered.","symbol":"GATA1-Related X-Linked Cytopenia","medgen_id":"C1845837","alternate_names":[],"type":"Disease","alternate_symbols":["XLTDA"],"xrefs":["{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000509192\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_symbols\",\"ref_field_element\":\"XLTDA\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"dyserythropoietic-anemia-and-thrombocytopenia\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}"],"name":"gene sequencing","keywords":[],"id":"40768"}

{"attribute_content":[],"public_definition":"In general, gallbladder disease (GBD) is one of the major digestive diseases. GBD prevalence is particularly high in some minority populations in the United States, including Native and Mexican Americans. Gallstones composed of cholesterol (cholelithiasis) are the common manifestations of GBD in western countries, including the United States. Most people with gallstones remain asymptomatic through their lifetimes; however, it is estimated that approximately 10 to 50% of individuals eventually develop symptoms. Significant risk factors associated with GBD are age, female sex, obesity (especially central obesity), lipids, diet, parity, type 2 diabetes (125853), medications, and Mexican American ethnicity. GBD appears to be strongly related to the metabolic syndrome (605552) and/or its major components, such as hyperinsulinism, dyslipidemia, and abdominal adiposity (Boland et al., 2002; Tsai et al., 2004). Infection, specifically by Helicobacter, has been implicated in cholelithiasis and cholecystitis (Silva et al., 2003; Maurer et al., 2005).\r\nLow phospholipid-associated cholelithiasis is a specific form of gallbladder disease characterized by young-adult onset of chronic cholestasis with intrahepatic sludge and cholesterol cholelithiasis. Affected individuals have recurrence of the disorder after cholecystectomy and show a favorable response to treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) (summary by Pasmant et al., 2012).\r\nMutation in the ABCB4 gene can cause a spectrum of related diseases, including the more severe progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis-3 (PFIC3; 602347), intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy-3 (ICP3; 614972), andoral contraceptive-induced cholestasis (OCIC; see 614972).\r\nGenetic Heterogeneity of Gallbladder Disease\r\nTwo major susceptibility loci for symptomatic gallbladder disease have been identified on chromosome 1p in Mexican Americans (GBD2, 609918; GBD3, 609919). In addition, variations in the ABCG8 gene (605460) on chromosome 2p21 confer susceptibility to gallbladder disease (GBD4; 611465).","symbol":"GBD1","medgen_id":"C2609268","alternate_names":["CHOLELITHIASIS, LOW PHOSPHOLIPID-ASSOCIATED"],"type":"Disease","alternate_symbols":["LPAC"],"xrefs":["{\"db\":\"Human Phenotype Ontology\",\"id\":\"HP:0001082\",\"type\":\"primary\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"600803\",\"type\":\"MIM\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"69663\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"600803\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"CHOLELITHIASIS, LOW PHOSPHOLIPID-ASSOCIATED\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"600803\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_symbols\",\"ref_field_element\":\"LPAC\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"600803\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"600803\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"symbol\"}"],"name":"Gallbladder disease 1","keywords":[],"id":"1908"}

This form of diabetes is characterized by high blood sugar levels (hyperglycemia) resulting from a shortage of the hormone insulin. Insulin controls how much glucose (a type of sugar) is passed from the blood into cells for conversion to energy.Individuals with permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus experience slow growth before birth (intrauterine growth retardation). Affected infants have hyperglycemia and an excessive loss of fluids (dehydration) and are unable to gain weight and grow at the expected rate (failure to thrive).In some cases, people with permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus also have certain neurological problems, including developmental delay and recurrent seizures (epilepsy). This combination of developmental delay, epilepsy, and neonatal diabetes is called DEND syndrome. Intermediate DEND syndrome is a similar combination but with milder developmental delay and without epilepsy.A small number of individuals with permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus have an underdeveloped pancreas.

{"attribute_content":[],"public_definition":"Age-related macular degeneration is an eye disease that is a leading cause of vision loss in older people in developed countries. Subtle abnormalities indicating changes in vision may occur in a person's forties or fifties. Distorted vision and vision loss usually become noticeable in a person's sixties or seventies and tend to worsen over time.Age-related macular degeneration mainly affects central vision, which is needed for detailed tasks such as reading, driving, and recognizing faces. The vision loss in this condition results from a gradual deterioration of light-sensing cells in the tissue at the back of the eye that detects light and color (the retina). Specifically, age-related macular degeneration affects a small area near the center of the retina, called the macula, which is responsible for central vision. Side (peripheral) vision and night vision are generally not affected, but slow adjustment of vision to darkness (dark adaptation) and reduced dim light (scotopic) vision often occur in the early stages of the disease.Researchers have described two major types of age-related macular degeneration, known as the dry form and the wet form. The dry form is much more common, accounting for 85 to 90 percent of all cases of age-related macular degeneration. It is characterized by a buildup of yellowish deposits called drusen beneath the retina and vision loss that worsens slowly over time. The most advanced stage of dry age-related macular degeneration is known as geographic atrophy, in which areas of the macula waste away (atrophy), resulting in severe vision loss. Dry age-related macular degeneration typically affects vision in both eyes, although vision loss often occurs in one eye before the other.In 10 to 15 percent of affected individuals, the dry form progresses to the wet form of age-related macular degeneration. The wet form is characterized by the growth of abnormal, fragile blood vessels underneath the macula. These vessels leak blood and fluid, which damages the macula and makes central vision appear blurry and distorted.

They may also have external genitalia that appear female or that do not look clearly male or clearly female (ambiguous genitalia). In affected infants who are genetically female, with two X chromosomes in each cell, development of the internal and external reproductive organs is normal.SIDDT is associated with abnormal development of the brain, particularly the brainstem, which is the part of the brain that is connected to the spinal cord. The brainstem regulates many basic body functions, including heart rate, breathing, eating, and sleeping. It also relays information about movement and the senses between the brain and the rest of the body. Many features of SIDDT appear to be related to brainstem malfunction, including a slow or uneven heart rate, abnormal breathing patterns, difficulty controlling body temperature, unusual tongue and eye movements, an exaggerated startle reflex to sudden lights or loud noises, and feeding difficulties. Affected infants also have an unusual cry that has been described as similar to the bleating of a goat, which is probably a result of abnormal nerve connections between the brain and the voicebox (larynx).The brainstem abnormalities lead to death in the first year of life, when affected infants suddenly stop breathing or their heart stops beating (cardiorespiratory arrest).","symbol":"SIDDT","medgen_id":"C1837371","alternate_names":[],"type":"Disease","alternate_symbols":[],"xrefs":["{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"608800\",\"type\":\"MIM\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"168593\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Alliance\",\"id\":\"Sudden+infant+death+with+dysgenesis+of+the+testes+syndrome/9364\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"sudden-infant-death-with-dysgenesis-of-the-testes-syndrome\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"608800\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"symbol\"}"],"name":"Sudden infant death with dysgenesis of the testes syndrome","keywords":[],"id":"4473"}

{"attribute_content":[],"public_definition":"Congenital hypothyroidism is a partial or complete loss of function of the thyroid gland (hypothyroidism) that affects infants from birth (congenital). The thyroid gland is a butterfly-shaped tissue in the lower neck. It makes iodine-containing hormones that play an important role in regulating growth, brain development, and the rate of chemical reactions in the body (metabolism). People with congenital hypothyroidism have lower-than-normal levels of these important hormones.Congenital hypothyroidism occurs when the thyroid gland fails to develop or function properly. In 80 to 85 percent of cases, the thyroid gland is absent, severely reduced in size (hypoplastic), or abnormally located. These cases are classified as thyroid dysgenesis. In the remainder of cases, a normal-sized or enlarged thyroid gland (goiter) is present, but production of thyroid hormones is decreased or absent. Most of these cases occur when one of several steps in the hormone synthesis process is impaired; these cases are classified as thyroid dyshormonogenesis. Less commonly, reduction or absence of thyroid hormone production is caused by impaired stimulation of the production process (which is normally done by a structure at the base of the brain called the pituitary gland), even though the process itself is unimpaired. These cases are classified as central (or pituitary) hypothyroidism.Signs and symptoms of congenital hypothyroidism result from the shortage of thyroid hormones. Affected babies may show no features of the condition, although some babies with congenital hypothyroidism are less active and sleep more than normal. They may have difficulty feeding and experience constipation. If untreated, congenital hypothyroidism can lead to intellectual disability and slow growth. In the United States and many other countries, all hospitals test newborns for congenital hypothyroidism.

{"attribute_content":[],"public_definition":"Oral-facial-digital syndrome is actually a group of related conditions that affect the development of the oral cavity (the mouth and teeth), facial features, and digits (fingers and toes).Researchers have identified at least 13 potential forms of oral-facial-digital syndrome. The different types are classified by their patterns of signs and symptoms. However, the features of the various types overlap significantly, and some types are not well defined. The classification system for oral-facial-digital syndrome continues to evolve as researchers find more affected individuals and learn more about this disorder.The signs and symptoms of oral-facial-digital syndrome vary widely. However, most forms of this disorder involve problems with development of the oral cavity, facial features, and digits. Most forms are also associated with brain abnormalities and some degree of intellectual disability.Abnormalities of the oral cavity that occur in many types of oral-facial-digital syndrome include a split (cleft) in the tongue, a tongue with an unusual lobed shape, and the growth of noncancerous tumors or nodules on the tongue. Affected individuals may also have extra, missing, or defective teeth. Another common feature is an opening in the roof of the mouth (a cleft palate). Some people with oral-facial-digital syndrome have bands of extra tissue (called hyperplastic frenula) that abnormally attach the lip to the gums.Distinctive facial features often associated with oral-facial-digital syndrome include a split in the lip (a cleft lip); a wide nose with a broad, flat nasal bridge; and widely spaced eyes (hypertelorism).Abnormalities of the digits can affect both the fingers and the toes in people with oral-facial-digital syndrome. These abnormalities include fusion of certain fingers or toes (syndactyly), digits that are shorter than usual (brachydactyly), or digits that are unusually curved (clinodactyly). The presence of extra digits (polydactyly) is also seen in most forms of oral-facial-digital syndrome.Other features occur in only one or a few types of oral-facial digital syndrome. These features help distinguish the different forms of the disorder. For example, the most common form of oral-facial-digital syndrome, type I, is associated with polycystic kidney disease. This kidney disease is characterized by the growth of fluid-filled sacs (cysts) that interfere with the kidneys' ability to filter waste products from the blood. Other forms of oral-facial-digital syndrome are characterized by neurological problems, particular changes in the structure of the brain, bone abnormalities, vision loss, and heart defects.","medgen_id":"C0029294","alternate_names":[],"type":"Disease","alternate_symbols":[],"xrefs":["{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"PS311200\",\"type\":\"Phenotypic series\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"140997\"}","{\"db\":\"Office of Rare Diseases\",\"id\":\"10692\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"oral-facial-digital-syndrome\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}"],"name":"Orofaciodigital syndromes","keywords":[],"id":"7410"}

{"attribute_content":[],"public_definition":"Hereditary cerebral amyloid angiopathy is a condition that can cause a progressive loss of intellectual function (dementia), stroke, and other neurological problems starting in mid-adulthood. Due to neurological decline, this condition is typically fatal in one's sixties, although there is variation depending on the severity of the signs and symptoms. Most affected individuals die within a decade after signs and symptoms first appear, although some people with the disease have survived longer.There are many different types of hereditary cerebral amyloid angiopathy. The different types are distinguished by their genetic cause and the signs and symptoms that occur. The various types of hereditary cerebral amyloid angiopathy are named after the regions where they were first diagnosed.The Dutch type of hereditary cerebral amyloid angiopathy is the most common form. Stroke is frequently the first sign of the Dutch type and is fatal in about one third of people who have this condition. Survivors often develop dementia and have recurrent strokes. About half of individuals with the Dutch type who have one or more strokes will have recurrent seizures (epilepsy).People with the Flemish and Italian types of hereditary cerebral amyloid angiopathy are prone to recurrent strokes and dementia. Individuals with the Piedmont type may have one or more strokes and typically experience impaired movements, numbness or tingling (paresthesias), confusion, or dementia.The first sign of the Icelandic type of hereditary cerebral amyloid angiopathy is typically a stroke followed by dementia. Strokes associated with the Icelandic type usually occur earlier than the other types, with individuals typically experiencing their first stroke in their twenties or thirties.Strokes are rare in people with the Arctic type of hereditary cerebral amyloid angiopathy, in which the first sign is usually memory loss that then progresses to severe dementia. Strokes are also uncommon in individuals with the Iowa type. This type is characterized by memory loss, problems with vocabulary and the production of speech, personality changes, and involuntary muscle twitches (myoclonus).Two types of hereditary cerebral amyloid angiopathy, known as familial British dementia and familial Danish dementia, are characterized by dementia and movement problems. Strokes are uncommon in these types. People with the Danish type may also have clouding of the lens of the eyes (cataracts) or deafness.","medgen_id":"C1861735","alternate_names":["CEREBRAL AMYLOID ANGIOPATHY, ITM2B-RELATED, 2"],"type":"Disease","alternate_symbols":["FDD","HOOE"],"xrefs":["{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"117300\",\"type\":\"MIM\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"439254\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"117300\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"CEREBRAL AMYLOID ANGIOPATHY, ITM2B-RELATED, 2\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"117300\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_symbols\",\"ref_field_element\":\"FDD\"}","{\"db\":\"Office of Rare Diseases\",\"id\":\"9169\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_symbols\",\"ref_field_element\":\"FDD\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"117300\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_symbols\",\"ref_field_element\":\"HOOE\"}","{\"db\":\"Office of Rare Diseases\",\"id\":\"9169\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_symbols\",\"ref_field_element\":\"HOOE\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Alliance\",\"id\":\"Dementia%2C+Familial+Danish/2183\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Office of Rare Diseases\",\"id\":\"9169\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"hereditary-cerebral-amyloid-angiopathy\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}"],"name":"Dementia, familial Danish","keywords":[],"id":"4770"}

{"attribute_content":[],"public_definition":"Ovarian cancer is a disease that affects women. In this form of cancer, certain cells in the ovary become abnormal and multiply uncontrollably to form a tumor. The ovaries are the female reproductive organs in which egg cells are produced. In about 90 percent of cases, ovarian cancer occurs after age 40, and most cases occur after age 60.The most common form of ovarian cancer begins in epithelial cells, which are the cells that line the surfaces and cavities of the body. These cancers can arise in the epithelial cells on the surface of the ovary. However, researchers suggest that many or even most ovarian cancers begin in epithelial cells on the fringes (fimbriae) at the end of one of the fallopian tubes, and the cancerous cells migrate to the ovary.Cancer can also begin in epithelial cells that form the lining of the abdomen (the peritoneum). This form of cancer, called primary peritoneal cancer, resembles epithelial ovarian cancer in its origin, symptoms, progression, and treatment. Primary peritoneal cancer often spreads to the ovaries. It can also occur even if the ovaries have been removed. Because cancers that begin in the ovaries, fallopian tubes, and peritoneum are so similar and spread easily from one of these structures to the others, they are often difficult to distinguish. These cancers are so closely related that they are generally considered collectively by experts.In about 10 percent of cases, ovarian cancer develops not in epithelial cells but in germ cells, which are precursors to egg cells, or in hormone-producing ovarian cells called granulosa cells.In its early stages, ovarian cancer usually does not cause noticeable symptoms. As the cancer progresses, signs and symptoms can include pain or a feeling of heaviness in the pelvis or lower abdomen, bloating, feeling full quickly when eating, back pain, vaginal bleeding between menstrual periods or after menopause, or changes in urinary or bowel habits. However, these changes can occur as part of many different conditions. Having one or more of these symptoms does not mean that a woman has ovarian cancer.In some cases, cancerous tumors can invade surrounding tissue and spread to other parts of the body. If ovarian cancer spreads, cancerous tumors most often appear in the abdominal cavity or on the surfaces of nearby organs such as the bladder or colon. Tumors that begin at one site and then spread to other areas of the body are called metastatic cancers.Some ovarian cancers cluster in families. These cancers are described as hereditary and are associated with inherited gene mutations. Hereditary ovarian cancers tend to develop earlier in life than non-inherited (sporadic) cases.Because it is often diagnosed at a late stage, ovarian cancer can be difficult to treat; it leads to the deaths of about 14,000 women annually in the United States, more than any other gynecological cancer. However, when it is diagnosed and treated early, the 5-year survival rate is high.","medgen_id":"CN221562","alternate_names":[],"type":"Disease","alternate_symbols":[],"xrefs":["{\"db\":\"CSER _CC_NCGL, University of Washington\",\"id\":\"UWMG_7622958\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"ovarian-cancer\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}"],"name":"Breast and/or ovarian cancer","keywords":[],"id":"32337"}

{"attribute_content":[],"public_definition":"Congenital hypothyroidism is a partial or complete loss of function of the thyroid gland (hypothyroidism) that affects infants from birth (congenital). The thyroid gland is a butterfly-shaped tissue in the lower neck. It makes iodine-containing hormones that play an important role in regulating growth, brain development, and the rate of chemical reactions in the body (metabolism). People with congenital hypothyroidism have lower-than-normal levels of these important hormones.Congenital hypothyroidism occurs when the thyroid gland fails to develop or function properly. In 80 to 85 percent of cases, the thyroid gland is absent, severely reduced in size (hypoplastic), or abnormally located. These cases are classified as thyroid dysgenesis. In the remainder of cases, a normal-sized or enlarged thyroid gland (goiter) is present, but production of thyroid hormones is decreased or absent. Most of these cases occur when one of several steps in the hormone synthesis process is impaired; these cases are classified as thyroid dyshormonogenesis. Less commonly, reduction or absence of thyroid hormone production is caused by impaired stimulation of the production process (which is normally done by a structure at the base of the brain called the pituitary gland), even though the process itself is unimpaired. These cases are classified as central (or pituitary) hypothyroidism.Signs and symptoms of congenital hypothyroidism result from the shortage of thyroid hormones. Affected babies may show no features of the condition, although some babies with congenital hypothyroidism are less active and sleep more than normal. They may have difficulty feeding and experience constipation. If untreated, congenital hypothyroidism can lead to intellectual disability and slow growth. In the United States and many other countries, all hospitals test newborns for congenital hypothyroidism. If treatment begins in the first two weeks after birth, infants usually develop normally.Congenital hypothyroidism can also occur as part of syndromes that affect other organs and tissues in the body. These forms of the condition are described as syndromic. Some common forms of syndromic hypothyroidism include Pendred syndrome, Bamforth-Lazarus syndrome, and brain-lung-thyroid syndrome.","symbol":"TDH6","medgen_id":"C1846632","alternate_names":["HYPOTHYROIDISM, CONGENITAL, DUE TO DYSHORMONOGENESIS, 6","THYROID HORMONOGENESIS, GENETIC DEFECT IN, 6"],"type":"Disease","alternate_symbols":["TH6"],"xrefs":["{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"607200\",\"type\":\"MIM\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"95716\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"607200\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"HYPOTHYROIDISM, CONGENITAL, DUE TO DYSHORMONOGENESIS, 6\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"607200\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"THYROID HORMONOGENESIS, GENETIC DEFECT IN, 6\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Alliance\",\"id\":\"Thyroid+dyshormonogenesis+6/9402\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"congenital-hypothyroidism\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"607200\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"symbol\"}"],"name":"Thyroid dyshormonogenesis 6","keywords":[],"id":"4558"}

{"attribute_content":[],"public_definition":"Autoimmune polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy (APECED) is an inherited condition that affects many of the body's organs. It is one of many autoimmune diseases, which are disorders that occur when the immune system malfunctions and attacks the body's own tissues and organs by mistake.In most cases, the signs and symptoms of APECED begin in childhood or adolescence. This condition commonly involves three characteristic features: chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis (CMC), hypoparathyroidism, and adrenal gland insufficiency. Affected individuals typically have at least two of these features, and many have all three.CMC is a tendency to develop infections of the skin, the nails, and the moist lining of body cavities (mucous membranes) caused by a type of fungus called Candida. These infections, which are commonly known as yeast infections, are chronic, which means they recur and can last a long time. CMC is usually the first of the three characteristic features of APECED to become apparent in people with this disorder. Almost all affected individuals develop infections of the oral cavity (known as thrush). Infections of the tube that carries food from the mouth to the stomach (the esophagus) are also common, while the skin and nails are affected less often. In women, vaginal infections frequently occur.Other features of APECED result from the body's immune system attacking the network of hormone-producing glands (the endocrine system). The second characteristic feature of the disorder is hypoparathyroidism, which is a malfunction of the parathyroid glands. These glands secrete a hormone that regulates the body's use of calcium and phosphorus. Damage to the parathyroid glands leads to reduced parathyroid hormone production (hypoparathyroidism). Hypoparathyroidism can cause a tingling sensation in the lips, fingers, and toes; muscle pain and cramping; weakness; and fatigue. Serious effects of hypoparathyroidism, such spasms of the voicebox (larynx) leading to breathing problems and seizures, can be life-threatening.Damage to the small hormone-producing glands on top of each kidney (adrenal glands) results in a third major feature of APECED, adrenal gland insufficiency (Addison disease). Reduced hormone production by the adrenal glands leads to signs and symptoms that can include fatigue, muscle weakness, loss of appetite, weight loss, low blood pressure, and changes in skin coloring. Other endocrine problems that can occur in APECED include type 1 diabetes resulting from impaired production of the hormone insulin; a shortage of growth hormone leading to short stature; problems affecting the internal reproductive organs (ovaries or testes) that can cause inability to conceive children (infertility); and dysfunction of the thyroid gland (a butterfly-shaped tissue in the lower neck), which can result in many symptoms including weight gain and fatigue.Autoimmune problems affecting non-endocrine tissues can lead to a variety of additional signs and symptoms in people with APECED. These features occur more often in North American populations than in European populations. Rashes that resemble hives (urticarial eruptions) are common and often occur in infancy and early childhood. Other early signs and symptoms may include thin enamel on the teeth (enamel hypoplasia) and chronic diarrhea or constipation associated with difficulty in absorbing nutrients from food. Additional features that occur in people with APECED, many of which can lead to permanent organ and tissue damage if left untreated, include stomach irritation (gastritis), liver inflammation (hepatitis), lung irritation (pneumonitis), dry mouth and dry eyes (Sjogren-like syndrome), inflammation of the eyes (keratitis), kidney problems (nephritis), vitamin B12 deficiency, hair loss (alopecia), loss of skin color in blotches (vitiligo), high blood pressure (hypertension), or a small (atrophic) or absent spleen (asplenia).","medgen_id":"C2749602","alternate_names":["AUTOIMMUNE POLYENDOCRINOPATHY SYNDROME, TYPE I, WITH REVERSIBLE METAPHYSEAL DYSPLASIA"],"type":"Disease","alternate_symbols":[],"xrefs":["{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"607358.0003\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"AUTOIMMUNE POLYENDOCRINOPATHY SYNDROME, TYPE I, WITH REVERSIBLE METAPHYSEAL DYSPLASIA\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"607358.0009\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"AUTOIMMUNE POLYENDOCRINOPATHY SYNDROME, TYPE I, WITH REVERSIBLE METAPHYSEAL DYSPLASIA\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"autoimmune-polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal-dystrophy\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}"],"name":"Autoimmune polyglandular syndrome type 1, with reversible metaphyseal dysplasia","keywords":[],"id":"9293"}

{"attribute_content":[],"public_definition":"Baraitser-Winter syndrome is a condition that affects the development of many parts of the body, particularly the face and the brain.An unusual facial appearance is the most common characteristic of Baraitser-Winter syndrome. Distinctive facial features can include widely spaced eyes (hypertelorism), large eyelid openings, droopy eyelids (ptosis), high-arched eyebrows, a broad nasal bridge and tip of the nose, a long space between the nose and upper lip (philtrum), full cheeks, and a pointed chin.Structural brain abnormalities are also present in most people with Baraitser-Winter syndrome. These abnormalities are related to impaired neuronal migration, a process by which nerve cells (neurons) move to their proper positions in the developing brain. The most frequent brain abnormality associated with Baraitser-Winter syndrome is pachygyria, which is an area of the brain that has an abnormally smooth surface with fewer folds and grooves. Less commonly, affected individuals have lissencephaly, which is similar to pachygyria but involves the entire brain surface. These structural changes can cause mild to severe intellectual disability, developmental delay, and seizures.Other features of Baraitser-Winter syndrome can include short stature, ear abnormalities and hearing loss, heart defects, presence of an extra (duplicated) thumb, and abnormalities of the kidneys and urinary system.

{"attribute_content":[],"public_definition":"Congenital dyserythropoietic anemia (CDA) is an inherited blood disorder that affects the development of red blood cells. This disorder is one of many types of anemia, which is a condition characterized by a shortage of red blood cells. This shortage prevents the blood from carrying an adequate supply of oxygen to the body's tissues. The resulting symptoms can include tiredness (fatigue), weakness, pale skin, and other complications.Researchers have identified three major types of CDA: type I, type II, and type III. The types have different genetic causes and different but overlapping patterns of signs and symptoms.CDA type I is characterized by moderate to severe anemia. It is usually diagnosed in childhood or adolescence, although in some cases, the condition can be detected before birth. Many affected individuals have yellowing of the skin and eyes (jaundice) and an enlarged liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly). This condition also causes the body to absorb too much iron, which builds up and can damage tissues and organs. In particular, iron overload can lead to an abnormal heart rhythm (arrhythmia), congestive heart failure, diabetes, and chronic liver disease (cirrhosis). Rarely, people with CDA type I are born with skeletal abnormalities, most often involving the fingers and/or toes.The anemia associated with CDA type II can range from mild to severe, and most affected individuals have jaundice, hepatosplenomegaly, and the formation of hard deposits in the gallbladder called gallstones. This form of the disorder is usually diagnosed in adolescence or early adulthood. An abnormal buildup of iron typically occurs after age 20, leading to complications including heart disease, diabetes, and cirrhosis.The signs and symptoms of CDA type III tend to be milder than those of the other types. Most affected individuals do not have hepatosplenomegaly, and iron does not build up in tissues and organs. In adulthood, abnormalities of a specialized tissue at the back of the eye (the retina) can cause vision impairment. Some people with CDA type III also have a blood disorder known as monoclonal gammopathy, which can lead to a cancer of white blood cells (multiple myeloma).Several other variants of CDA have been described, although they appear to be rare and not much is known about them. Once researchers discover the genetic causes of these variants, some of them may be grouped with the three major types of CDA.","medgen_id":"C0002876","alternate_names":[],"type":"Disease","alternate_symbols":[],"xrefs":["{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"PS224120\",\"type\":\"Phenotypic series\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"85\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"85\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"congenital-dyserythropoietic-anemia\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}"],"name":"Congenital dyserythropoietic anemia","keywords":[],"id":"35617"}

Iron is an essential component of hemoglobin, which is the substance that red blood cells use to carry oxygen to cells and tissues throughout the body. In this condition, red blood cells cannot access iron in the blood, so there is a decrease of red blood cell production (anemia) that is apparent at birth. The red blood cells that are produced are abnormally small (microcytic) and pale (hypochromic). Hypochromic microcytic anemia with iron overload can lead to pale skin (pallor), tiredness (fatigue), and slow growth.In hypochromic microcytic anemia with iron overload, the iron that is not used by red blood cells accumulates in the liver, which can impair its function over time.

Subtle abnormalities indicating changes in vision may occur in a person's forties or fifties. Distorted vision and vision loss usually become noticeable in a person's sixties or seventies and tend to worsen over time.Age-related macular degeneration mainly affects central vision, which is needed for detailed tasks such as reading, driving, and recognizing faces. The vision loss in this condition results from a gradual deterioration of light-sensing cells in the tissue at the back of the eye that detects light and color (the retina). Specifically, age-related macular degeneration affects a small area near the center of the retina, called the macula, which is responsible for central vision. Side (peripheral) vision and night vision are generally not affected, but slow adjustment of vision to darkness (dark adaptation) and reduced dim light (scotopic) vision often occur in the early stages of the disease.Researchers have described two major types of age-related macular degeneration, known as the dry form and the wet form. The dry form is much more common, accounting for 85 to 90 percent of all cases of age-related macular degeneration. It is characterized by a buildup of yellowish deposits called drusen beneath the retina and vision loss that worsens slowly over time. The most advanced stage of dry age-related macular degeneration is known as geographic atrophy, in which areas of the macula waste away (atrophy), resulting in severe vision loss. Dry age-related macular degeneration typically affects vision in both eyes, although vision loss often occurs in one eye before the other.In 10 to 15 percent of affected individuals, the dry form progresses to the wet form of age-related macular degeneration. The wet form is characterized by the growth of abnormal, fragile blood vessels underneath the macula.

{"attribute_content":[],"public_definition":"Type 1 diabetes is a disorder characterized by abnormally high blood sugar levels. In this form of diabetes, specialized cells in the pancreas called beta cells stop producing insulin. Insulin controls how much glucose (a type of sugar) is passed from the blood into cells for conversion to energy. Lack of insulin results in the inability to use glucose for energy or to control the amount of sugar in the blood.Type 1 diabetes can occur at any age, from early childhood to late adulthood. The first signs and symptoms of the disorder are caused by high blood sugar and may include frequent urination (polyuria), excessive thirst (polydipsia), fatigue, blurred vision, tingling or loss of feeling in the hands and feet, and weight loss. These symptoms may recur during the course of the disorder if blood sugar is not well controlled by insulin replacement therapy. Improper control can also cause blood sugar levels to become too low (hypoglycemia). This may occur when the body's needs change, such as during exercise or if eating is delayed. Hypoglycemia can cause headache, dizziness, hunger, shaking, sweating, weakness, and agitation.Uncontrolled type 1 diabetes can lead to a life-threatening complication called diabetic ketoacidosis. Without insulin, cells cannot take in glucose. A lack of glucose in cells prompts the liver to try to compensate by releasing more glucose into the blood, and blood sugar can become extremely high. The cells, unable to use the glucose in the blood for energy, respond by using fats instead. Breaking down fats to obtain energy produces waste products called ketones, which can build up to toxic levels in people with type 1 diabetes, resulting in diabetic ketoacidosis. Affected individuals may begin breathing rapidly; develop a fruity odor in the breath; and experience nausea, vomiting, facial flushing, stomach pain, and dryness of the mouth (xerostomia). In severe cases, diabetic ketoacidosis can lead to coma and death.Over many years, the chronic high blood sugar associated with diabetes may cause damage to blood vessels and nerves, leading to complications affecting many organs and tissues. The retina, which is the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye, can be damaged (diabetic retinopathy), leading to vision loss and eventual blindness. Kidney damage (diabetic nephropathy) may also occur and can lead to kidney failure and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Pain, tingling, and loss of normal sensation (diabetic neuropathy) often occur, especially in the feet. Impaired circulation and absence of the normal sensations that prompt reaction to injury can result in permanent damage to the feet; in severe cases, the damage can lead to amputation. People with type 1 diabetes are also at increased risk of heart attacks, strokes, and problems with urinary and sexual function.","symbol":"IDDM20","medgen_id":"C2675866","alternate_names":[],"type":"Disease","alternate_symbols":[],"xrefs":["{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"612520\",\"type\":\"MIM\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"type-1-diabetes\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"612520\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"symbol\"}"],"name":"Diabetes mellitus, insulin-dependent, 20","keywords":[],"id":"1476"}

{"attribute_content":[],"public_definition":"Progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC) is a disorder that causes progressive liver disease, which typically leads to liver failure. In people with PFIC, liver cells are less able to secrete a digestive fluid called bile. The buildup of bile in liver cells causes liver disease in affected individuals.Signs and symptoms of PFIC typically begin in infancy and are related to bile buildup and liver disease. Specifically, affected individuals experience severe itching, yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice), failure to gain weight and grow at the expected rate (failure to thrive), high blood pressure in the vein that supplies blood to the liver (portal hypertension), and an enlarged liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly).There are three known types of PFIC: PFIC1, PFIC2, and PFIC3. The types are also sometimes described as shortages of particular proteins needed for normal liver function. Each type has a different genetic cause.In addition to signs and symptoms related to liver disease, people with PFIC1 may have short stature, deafness, diarrhea, inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis), and low levels of fat-soluble vitamins (vitamins A, D, E, and K) in the blood. Affected individuals typically develop liver failure before adulthood.The signs and symptoms of PFIC2 are typically related to liver disease only; however, these signs and symptoms tend to be more severe than those experienced by people with PFIC1. People with PFIC2 often develop liver failure within the first few years of life. Additionally, affected individuals are at increased risk of developing a type of liver cancer called hepatocellular carcinoma.Most people with PFIC3 have signs and symptoms related to liver disease only. Signs and symptoms of PFIC3 usually do not appear until later in infancy or early childhood; rarely, people are diagnosed in early adulthood. Liver failure can occur in childhood or adulthood in people with PFIC3.","symbol":"PFIC","medgen_id":"C0268312","alternate_names":["Familial Intrahepatic Cholestasis","Progressive intrahepatic cholestasis"],"type":"Disease","alternate_symbols":[],"xrefs":["{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"PS211600\",\"type\":\"Phenotypic series\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"172\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Alliance\",\"id\":\"Progressive+intrahepatic+cholestasis/9166\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"Progressive intrahepatic cholestasis\"}","{\"db\":\"SNOMED CT\",\"id\":\"74162007\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"Progressive intrahepatic cholestasis\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"progressive-familial-intrahepatic-cholestasis\",\"ref_field\":\"ghr_links\"}","{\"db\":\"Office of Rare Diseases\",\"id\":\"9802\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"progressive-familial-intrahepatic-cholestasis\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}"],"name":"Progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis","keywords":[],"ghr_links":"progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis","id":"36535"}

{"attribute_content":[],"public_definition":"Type 1 diabetes is a disorder characterized by abnormally high blood sugar levels. In this form of diabetes, specialized cells in the pancreas called beta cells stop producing insulin. Insulin controls how much glucose (a type of sugar) is passed from the blood into cells for conversion to energy. Lack of insulin results in the inability to use glucose for energy or to control the amount of sugar in the blood.Type 1 diabetes can occur at any age, from early childhood to late adulthood. The first signs and symptoms of the disorder are caused by high blood sugar and may include frequent urination (polyuria), excessive thirst (polydipsia), fatigue, blurred vision, tingling or loss of feeling in the hands and feet, and weight loss. These symptoms may recur during the course of the disorder if blood sugar is not well controlled by insulin replacement therapy. Improper control can also cause blood sugar levels to become too low (hypoglycemia). This may occur when the body's needs change, such as during exercise or if eating is delayed. Hypoglycemia can cause headache, dizziness, hunger, shaking, sweating, weakness, and agitation.Uncontrolled type 1 diabetes can lead to a life-threatening complication called diabetic ketoacidosis. Without insulin, cells cannot take in glucose. A lack of glucose in cells prompts the liver to try to compensate by releasing more glucose into the blood, and blood sugar can become extremely high. The cells, unable to use the glucose in the blood for energy, respond by using fats instead. Breaking down fats to obtain energy produces waste products called ketones, which can build up to toxic levels in people with type 1 diabetes, resulting in diabetic ketoacidosis. Affected individuals may begin breathing rapidly; develop a fruity odor in the breath; and experience nausea, vomiting, facial flushing, stomach pain, and dryness of the mouth (xerostomia). In severe cases, diabetic ketoacidosis can lead to coma and death.Over many years, the chronic high blood sugar associated with diabetes may cause damage to blood vessels and nerves, leading to complications affecting many organs and tissues. The retina, which is the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye, can be damaged (diabetic retinopathy), leading to vision loss and eventual blindness. Kidney damage (diabetic nephropathy) may also occur and can lead to kidney failure and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Pain, tingling, and loss of normal sensation (diabetic neuropathy) often occur, especially in the feet. Impaired circulation and absence of the normal sensations that prompt reaction to injury can result in permanent damage to the feet; in severe cases, the damage can lead to amputation. People with type 1 diabetes are also at increased risk of heart attacks, strokes, and problems with urinary and sexual function.","symbol":"IDDM10","medgen_id":"C1866040","alternate_names":[],"type":"Disease","alternate_symbols":[],"xrefs":["{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"601942\",\"type\":\"MIM\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Alliance\",\"id\":\"Diabetes+mellitus%2C+insulin-dependent%2C+10/8216\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"type-1-diabetes\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"601942\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"symbol\"}"],"name":"Diabetes mellitus, insulin-dependent, 10","keywords":[],"id":"1965"}

{"attribute_content":[],"public_definition":"Age-related macular degeneration is an eye disease that is a leading cause of vision loss in older people in developed countries. Subtle abnormalities indicating changes in vision may occur in a person's forties or fifties. Distorted vision and vision loss usually become noticeable in a person's sixties or seventies and tend to worsen over time.Age-related macular degeneration mainly affects central vision, which is needed for detailed tasks such as reading, driving, and recognizing faces. The vision loss in this condition results from a gradual deterioration of light-sensing cells in the tissue at the back of the eye that detects light and color (the retina). Specifically, age-related macular degeneration affects a small area near the center of the retina, called the macula, which is responsible for central vision. Side (peripheral) vision and night vision are generally not affected, but slow adjustment of vision to darkness (dark adaptation) and reduced dim light (scotopic) vision often occur in the early stages of the disease.Researchers have described two major types of age-related macular degeneration, known as the dry form and the wet form. The dry form is much more common, accounting for 85 to 90 percent of all cases of age-related macular degeneration. It is characterized by a buildup of yellowish deposits called drusen beneath the retina and vision loss that worsens slowly over time. The most advanced stage of dry age-related macular degeneration is known as geographic atrophy, in which areas of the macula waste away (atrophy), resulting in severe vision loss. Dry age-related macular degeneration typically affects vision in both eyes, although vision loss often occurs in one eye before the other.In 10 to 15 percent of affected individuals, the dry form progresses to the wet form of age-related macular degeneration. The wet form is characterized by the growth of abnormal, fragile blood vessels underneath the macula. These vessels leak blood and fluid, which damages the macula and makes central vision appear blurry and distorted. The wet form of age-related macular degeneration is associated with severe vision loss that can worsen rapidly.","symbol":"ARMD9","medgen_id":"C1969651","alternate_names":[],"type":"Disease","alternate_symbols":[],"xrefs":["{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"611378\",\"type\":\"MIM\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Alliance\",\"id\":\"Age-related+macular+degeneration+9/7659\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"age-related-macular-degeneration\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"611378\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"symbol\"}"],"name":"Age-related macular degeneration 9","keywords":[],"id":"2633"}

{"attribute_content":[],"public_definition":"PDGFRA-associated chronic eosinophilic leukemia is a form of blood cell cancer characterized by an elevated number of cells called eosinophils in the blood. These cells help fight infections by certain parasites and are involved in the inflammation associated with allergic reactions. However, these circumstances do not account for the increased number of eosinophils in PDGFRA-associated chronic eosinophilic leukemia.Another characteristic feature of PDGFRA-associated chronic eosinophilic leukemia is organ damage caused by the excess eosinophils. Eosinophils release substances to aid in the immune response, but the release of excessive amounts of these substances causes damage to one or more organs, most commonly the heart, skin, lungs, or nervous system. Eosinophil-associated organ damage can lead to a heart condition known as eosinophilic endomyocardial disease, skin rashes, coughing, difficulty breathing, swelling (edema) in the lower limbs, confusion, changes in behavior, or impaired movement or sensations. People with PDGFRA-associated chronic eosinophilic leukemia can also have an enlarged spleen (splenomegaly) and elevated levels of certain chemicals called vitamin B12 and tryptase in the blood.Some people with PDGFRA-associated chronic eosinophilic leukemia have an increased number of other types of white blood cells, such as neutrophils or mast cells. Occasionally, people with PDGFRA-associated chronic eosinophilic leukemia develop other blood cell cancers, such as acute myeloid leukemia or B-cell or T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia or lymphoblastic lymphoma.PDGFRA-associated chronic eosinophilic leukemia is often grouped with a related condition called hypereosinophilic syndrome.

{"attribute_content":[],"public_definition":"Usher syndrome is a condition characterized by partial or total hearing loss and vision loss that worsens over time. The hearing loss is classified as sensorineural, which means that it is caused by abnormalities of the inner ear. The loss of vision is caused by an eye disease called retinitis pigmentosa (RP), which affects the layer of light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye (the retina). Vision loss occurs as the light-sensing cells of the retina gradually deteriorate. Night vision loss begins first, followed by blind spots that develop in the side (peripheral) vision. Over time, these blind spots enlarge and merge to produce tunnel vision. In some cases, vision is further impaired by clouding of the lens of the eye (cataracts). However, many people with retinitis pigmentosa retain some central vision throughout their lives.Researchers have identified three major types of Usher syndrome, designated as types I, II, and III. These types are distinguished by the severity of hearing loss, the presence or absence of balance problems, and the age at which signs and symptoms appear. The types are further divided into subtypes based on their genetic cause.Most individuals with Usher syndrome type I are born with severe to profound hearing loss. Progressive vision loss caused by retinitis pigmentosa becomes apparent in childhood. This type of Usher syndrome also causes abnormalities of the vestibular system, which is the part of the inner ear that helps maintain the body's balance and orientation in space. As a result of the vestibular abnormalities, children with the condition have trouble with balance. They begin sitting independently and walking later than usual, and they may have difficulty riding a bicycle and playing certain sports.Usher syndrome type II is characterized by hearing loss from birth and progressive vision loss that begins in adolescence or adulthood. The hearing loss associated with this form of Usher syndrome ranges from mild to severe and mainly affects the ability to hear high-frequency sounds. For example, it is difficult for affected individuals to hear high, soft speech sounds, such as those of the letters d and t. The degree of hearing loss varies within and among families with this condition, and it may become more severe over time. Unlike the other forms of Usher syndrome, type II is not associated with vestibular abnormalities that cause difficulties with balance.People with Usher syndrome type III experience hearing loss and vision loss beginning somewhat later in life. Unlike the other forms of Usher syndrome, type III is usually associated with normal hearing at birth. Hearing loss typically begins during late childhood or adolescence, after the development of speech, and becomes more severe over time. By middle age, most affected individuals have profound hearing loss. Vision loss caused by retinitis pigmentosa also develops in late childhood or adolescence. Some people with Usher syndrome type III develop vestibular abnormalities that cause problems with balance.","medgen_id":"C0271097","alternate_names":["Usher Syndromes"],"type":"Disease","alternate_symbols":[],"xrefs":["{\"db\":\"MeSH\",\"id\":\"D052245\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"PS276900\",\"type\":\"Phenotypic series\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"886\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000561956\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"usher-syndrome\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"886\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"usher-syndrome\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}"],"name":"Usher syndrome","keywords":[],"disease_mechanism":"loss of function","disease_mechanism_id":"273","id":"38085"}
{"attribute_content":[],"public_definition":"Dentinogenesis imperfecta is a disorder of tooth development. This condition causes the teeth to be discolored (most often a blue-gray or yellow-brown color) and translucent. Teeth are also weaker than normal, making them prone to rapid wear, breakage, and loss. These problems can affect both primary (baby) teeth and permanent teeth.Researchers have described three types of dentinogenesis imperfecta with similar dental abnormalities. Type I occurs in people who have osteogenesis imperfecta, a genetic condition in which bones are brittle and easily broken. Dentinogenesis imperfecta type II and type III usually occur in people without other inherited disorders. A few older individuals with type II have had progressive high-frequency hearing loss in addition to dental abnormalities, but it is not known whether this hearing loss is related to dentinogenesis imperfecta.Some researchers believe that dentinogenesis imperfecta type II and type III, along with a condition called dentin dysplasia type II, are actually forms of a single disorder. The signs and symptoms of dentin dysplasia type II are very similar to those of dentinogenesis imperfecta. However, dentin dysplasia type II affects the primary teeth much more than the permanent teeth.","symbol":"DGI1","medgen_id":"C2973527","alternate_names":["Hereditary Opalescent Dentin"],"type":"Disease","alternate_symbols":["DGI-II"],"xrefs":["{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"125490\",\"type\":\"MIM\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"166260\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"125490\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_symbols\",\"ref_field_element\":\"DGI-II\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000324340\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Alliance\",\"id\":\"Dentinogenesis+Imperfecta+1/2196\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"SNOMED CT\",\"id\":\"234969005\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"dentinogenesis-imperfecta\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"125490\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"symbol\"}"],"name":"Dentinogenesis imperfecta - Shield's type II","keywords":[],"disease_mechanism":"loss of function","disease_mechanism_id":"273","id":"1954"}

{"attribute_content":[],"public_definition":"Larsen syndrome is a disorder that affects the development of bones throughout the body. The signs and symptoms of Larsen syndrome vary widely even within the same family. Affected individuals are usually born with dislocations of the hips, knees, or elbows. Foot abnormalities, such as inward- and upward-turning feet (clubfeet), are also common. Affected individuals generally have small extra bones in their wrists and ankles that are visible on x-ray images. The tips of their fingers, especially the thumbs, are typically blunt and square-shaped (spatulate).Characteristic facial features in people with Larsen syndrome include a prominent forehead (frontal bossing), flattening of the bridge of the nose and middle of the face (midface hypoplasia), and wide-set eyes (ocular hypertelorism). Many people with Larsen syndrome have an opening in the roof of the mouth (a cleft palate). Affected individuals may also have hearing loss caused by malformations in tiny bones in the ears (ossicles).Short stature is a common feature of Larsen syndrome. In addition, people with the condition may have an unusually large range of joint movement (hypermobility) or joint deformities (contractures) that restrict movement. People with Larsen syndrome can also have abnormal curvature of the spine (kyphosis or scoliosis) that can impair breathing or compress the spinal cord and lead to weakness of the limbs. Some affected individuals experience respiratory problems, such as partial closing of the airways, short pauses in breathing (apnea), and frequent respiratory infections. Heart and kidney problems can also occur in people with Larsen syndrome. People with this condition can survive into adulthood. Their intellectual function is usually unaffected.","medgen_id":"C0175778","alternate_names":[],"type":"Disease","alternate_symbols":[],"xrefs":["{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"503\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000508858\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000522271\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000522272\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Alliance\",\"id\":\"Larsen+syndrome/4093\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"larsen-syndrome\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Office of Rare Diseases\",\"id\":\"6860\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"SNOMED CT\",\"id\":\"63387002\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"larsen-syndrome\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}"],"name":"Larsen syndrome","keywords":[],"disease_mechanism":"loss of function","disease_mechanism_id":"273","id":"14587"}

{"attribute_content":[],"public_definition":"Paramyotonia congenita is a disorder that affects muscles used for movement (skeletal muscles). Beginning in infancy or early childhood, people with this condition experience bouts of sustained muscle tensing (myotonia) that prevent muscles from relaxing normally. Myotonia causes muscle stiffness that typically appears after exercise and can be induced by muscle cooling. This stiffness chiefly affects muscles in the face, neck, arms, and hands, although it can also affect muscles used for breathing and muscles in the lower body. Unlike many other forms of myotonia, the muscle stiffness associated with paramyotonia congenita tends to worsen with repeated movements.Most people—even those without muscle disease—feel that their muscles do not work as well when they are cold. This effect is dramatic in people with paramyotonia congenita. Exposure to cold initially causes muscle stiffness in these individuals, and prolonged cold exposure leads to temporary episodes of mild to severe muscle weakness that may last for several hours at a time. Some older people with paramyotonia congenita develop permanent muscle weakness that can be disabling.","symbol":"PMC","medgen_id":"C0221055","alternate_names":[],"type":"Disease","alternate_symbols":[],"xrefs":["{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"168300\",\"type\":\"MIM\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"684\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000247968\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000332451\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000501215\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000509854\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000515740\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000558540\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000562505\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"paramyotonia-congenita\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"168300\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"symbol\"}","{\"db\":\"Office of Rare Diseases\",\"id\":\"7325\",\"ref_field\":\"symbol\"}"],"name":"Paramyotonia congenita of von Eulenburg","keywords":[],"content":"{\"Citation\":{\"@Abbrev\":\"EFNS, 2010\",\"@Type\":\"practice guideline\",\"ID\":{\"$\":\"20298421\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"}}}","disease_mechanism":"loss of function","disease_mechanism_id":"273","id":"3760"}

{"attribute_content":[],"public_definition":"Primary ciliary dyskinesia is a disorder characterized by chronic respiratory tract infections, abnormally positioned internal organs, and the inability to have children (infertility). The signs and symptoms of this condition are caused by abnormal cilia and flagella. Cilia are microscopic, finger-like projections that stick out from the surface of cells. They are found in the linings of the airway, the reproductive system, and other organs and tissues. Flagella are tail-like structures, similar to cilia, that propel sperm cells forward.In the respiratory tract, cilia move back and forth in a coordinated way to move mucus towards the throat. This movement of mucus helps to eliminate fluid, bacteria, and particles from the lungs. Most babies with primary ciliary dyskinesia experience breathing problems at birth, which suggests that cilia play an important role in clearing fetal fluid from the lungs. Beginning in early childhood, affected individuals develop frequent respiratory tract infections. Without properly functioning cilia in the airway, bacteria remain in the respiratory tract and cause infection. People with primary ciliary dyskinesia also have year-round nasal congestion and a chronic cough. Chronic respiratory tract infections can result in a condition called bronchiectasis, which damages the passages, called bronchi, leading from the windpipe to the lungs and can cause life-threatening breathing problems.Some individuals with primary ciliary dyskinesia have abnormally placed organs within their chest and abdomen. These abnormalities arise early in embryonic development when the differences between the left and right sides of the body are established. About 50 percent of people with primary ciliary dyskinesia have a mirror-image reversal of their internal organs (situs inversus totalis). For example, in these individuals the heart is on the right side of the body instead of on the left. Situs inversus totalis does not cause any apparent health problems. When someone with primary ciliary dyskinesia has situs inversus totalis, they are often said to have Kartagener syndrome.Approximately 12 percent of people with primary ciliary dyskinesia have a condition known as heterotaxy syndrome or situs ambiguus, which is characterized by abnormalities of the heart, liver, intestines, or spleen. These organs may be structurally abnormal or improperly positioned. In addition, affected individuals may lack a spleen (asplenia) or have multiple spleens (polysplenia). Heterotaxy syndrome results from problems establishing the left and right sides of the body during embryonic development. The severity of heterotaxy varies widely among affected individuals.Primary ciliary dyskinesia can also lead to infertility. Vigorous movements of the flagella are necessary to propel the sperm cells forward to the female egg cell. Because their sperm do not move properly, males with primary ciliary dyskinesia are usually unable to father children. Infertility occurs in some affected females and is likely due to abnormal cilia in the fallopian tubes.Another feature of primary ciliary dyskinesia is recurrent ear infections (otitis media), especially in young children. Otitis media can lead to permanent hearing loss if untreated. The ear infections are likely related to abnormal cilia within the inner ear.Rarely, individuals with primary ciliary dyskinesia have an accumulation of fluid in the brain (hydrocephalus), likely due to abnormal cilia in the brain.","symbol":"CILD11","medgen_id":"C2675229","alternate_names":["CILIARY DYSKINESIA, PRIMARY, 11, WITHOUT SITUS INVERSUS"],"type":"Disease","alternate_symbols":[],"xrefs":["{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"612649\",\"type\":\"MIM\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"244\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"612647.0001\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"CILIARY DYSKINESIA, PRIMARY, 11, WITHOUT SITUS INVERSUS\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"612647.0002\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"CILIARY DYSKINESIA, PRIMARY, 11, WITHOUT SITUS INVERSUS\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"612647.0003\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"CILIARY DYSKINESIA, PRIMARY, 11, WITHOUT SITUS INVERSUS\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"612647.0004\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"CILIARY DYSKINESIA, PRIMARY, 11, WITHOUT SITUS INVERSUS\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"612647.0005\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"CILIARY DYSKINESIA, PRIMARY, 11, WITHOUT SITUS INVERSUS\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"612647.0006\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"CILIARY DYSKINESIA, PRIMARY, 11, WITHOUT SITUS INVERSUS\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"612649\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"CILIARY DYSKINESIA, PRIMARY, 11, WITHOUT SITUS INVERSUS\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Alliance\",\"id\":\"Ciliary+dyskinesia%2C+primary%2C+11/7981\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"primary-ciliary-dyskinesia\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"612649\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"symbol\"}"],"name":"Ciliary dyskinesia, primary, 11","keywords":[],"content":"{\"Citation\":{\"@Abbrev\":\"GeneReviews\",\"@Type\":\"review\",\"ID\":[{\"$\":\"20301301\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"},{\"$\":\"NBK1122\",\"@Source\":\"BookShelf\"}]}}","id":"4806"}

{"attribute_content":[],"public_definition":"Primary ciliary dyskinesia is a disorder characterized by chronic respiratory tract infections, abnormally positioned internal organs, and the inability to have children (infertility). The signs and symptoms of this condition are caused by abnormal cilia and flagella. Cilia are microscopic, finger-like projections that stick out from the surface of cells. They are found in the linings of the airway, the reproductive system, and other organs and tissues. Flagella are tail-like structures, similar to cilia, that propel sperm cells forward.In the respiratory tract, cilia move back and forth in a coordinated way to move mucus towards the throat. This movement of mucus helps to eliminate fluid, bacteria, and particles from the lungs. Most babies with primary ciliary dyskinesia experience breathing problems at birth, which suggests that cilia play an important role in clearing fetal fluid from the lungs. Beginning in early childhood, affected individuals develop frequent respiratory tract infections. Without properly functioning cilia in the airway, bacteria remain in the respiratory tract and cause infection. People with primary ciliary dyskinesia also have year-round nasal congestion and a chronic cough. Chronic respiratory tract infections can result in a condition called bronchiectasis, which damages the passages, called bronchi, leading from the windpipe to the lungs and can cause life-threatening breathing problems.Some individuals with primary ciliary dyskinesia have abnormally placed organs within their chest and abdomen. These abnormalities arise early in embryonic development when the differences between the left and right sides of the body are established. About 50 percent of people with primary ciliary dyskinesia have a mirror-image reversal of their internal organs (situs inversus totalis). For example, in these individuals the heart is on the right side of the body instead of on the left. Situs inversus totalis does not cause any apparent health problems. When someone with primary ciliary dyskinesia has situs inversus totalis, they are often said to have Kartagener syndrome.Approximately 12 percent of people with primary ciliary dyskinesia have a condition known as heterotaxy syndrome or situs ambiguus, which is characterized by abnormalities of the heart, liver, intestines, or spleen. These organs may be structurally abnormal or improperly positioned. In addition, affected individuals may lack a spleen (asplenia) or have multiple spleens (polysplenia). Heterotaxy syndrome results from problems establishing the left and right sides of the body during embryonic development. The severity of heterotaxy varies widely among affected individuals.Primary ciliary dyskinesia can also lead to infertility. Vigorous movements of the flagella are necessary to propel the sperm cells forward to the female egg cell. Because their sperm do not move properly, males with primary ciliary dyskinesia are usually unable to father children. Infertility occurs in some affected females and is likely due to abnormal cilia in the fallopian tubes.Another feature of primary ciliary dyskinesia is recurrent ear infections (otitis media), especially in young children. Otitis media can lead to permanent hearing loss if untreated. The ear infections are likely related to abnormal cilia within the inner ear.Rarely, individuals with primary ciliary dyskinesia have an accumulation of fluid in the brain (hydrocephalus), likely due to abnormal cilia in the brain.","symbol":"CILD2","medgen_id":"C1847554","alternate_names":["CILIARY DYSKINESIA, PRIMARY, 2, WITH OR WITHOUT SITUS INVERSUS"],"type":"Disease","alternate_symbols":[],"xrefs":["{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"606763\",\"type\":\"MIM\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"244\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"606763\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"CILIARY DYSKINESIA, PRIMARY, 2, WITH OR WITHOUT SITUS INVERSUS\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Alliance\",\"id\":\"Ciliary+dyskinesia%2C+primary%2C+2/7987\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"primary-ciliary-dyskinesia\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"606763\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"symbol\"}"],"name":"Ciliary dyskinesia, primary, 2","keywords":[],"content":"{\"Citation\":{\"@Abbrev\":\"GeneReviews\",\"@Type\":\"review\",\"ID\":[{\"$\":\"20301301\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"},{\"$\":\"NBK1122\",\"@Source\":\"BookShelf\"}]}}","id":"4807"}

Other frequent malformations include fingers or toes that are fused together (syndactyly) or extra fingers or toes (polydactyly). These skeletal malformations are often described as acromelic, meaning that they occur in the bones that are away from the center of the body. Additional skeletal abnormalities involving the long bones of the arms and legs or the spinal bones (vertebrae) can also occur.

{"attribute_content":[],"public_definition":"Klippel-Feil syndrome is a bone disorder characterized by the abnormal joining (fusion) of two or more spinal bones in the neck (cervical vertebrae). The vertebral fusion is present from birth. Three major features result from this vertebral fusion: a short neck, the resulting appearance of a low hairline at the back of the head, and a limited range of motion in the neck. Most affected people have one or two of these characteristic features. Less than half of all individuals with Klippel-Feil syndrome have all three classic features of this condition.In people with Klippel-Feil syndrome, the fused vertebrae can limit the range of movement of the neck and back as well as lead to chronic headaches and muscle pain in the neck and back that range in severity. People with minimal bone involvement often have fewer problems compared to individuals with several vertebrae affected. The shortened neck can cause a slight difference in the size and shape of the right and left sides of the face (facial asymmetry). Trauma to the spine, such as a fall or car accident, can aggravate problems in the fused area. Fusion of the vertebrae can lead to nerve damage in the head, neck, or back. Over time, individuals with Klippel-Feil syndrome can develop a narrowing of the spinal canal (spinal stenosis) in the neck, which can compress and damage the spinal cord. Rarely, spinal nerve abnormalities may cause abnormal sensations or involuntary movements in people with Klippel-Feil syndrome. Affected individuals may develop a painful joint disorder called osteoarthritis around the areas of fused bone or experience painful involuntary tensing of the neck muscles (cervical dystonia). In addition to the fused cervical bones, people with this condition may have abnormalities in other vertebrae. Many people with Klippel-Feil syndrome have abnormal side-to-side curvature of the spine (scoliosis) due to malformation of the vertebrae; fusion of additional vertebrae below the neck may also occur.People with Klippel-Feil syndrome may have a wide variety of other features in addition to their spine abnormalities. Some people with this condition have hearing difficulties, eye abnormalities, an opening in the roof of the mouth (cleft palate), genitourinary problems such as abnormal kidneys or reproductive organs, heart abnormalities, or lung defects that can cause breathing problems. Affected individuals may have other skeletal defects including arms or legs of unequal length (limb length discrepancy), which can result in misalignment of the hips or knees. Additionally, the shoulder blades may be underdeveloped so that they sit abnormally high on the back, a condition called Sprengel deformity. Rarely, structural brain abnormalities or a type of birth defect that occurs during the development of the brain and spinal cord (neural tube defect) can occur in people with Klippel-Feil syndrome.In some cases, Klippel-Feil syndrome occurs as a feature of another disorder or syndrome, such as Wildervanck syndrome or hemifacial microsomia. In these instances, affected individuals have the signs and symptoms of both Klippel-Feil syndrome and the additional disorder.","symbol":"KFS1","medgen_id":"C1861689","alternate_names":["CERVICAL VERTEBRAL FUSION, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT"],"type":"Disease","alternate_symbols":[],"xrefs":["{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"118100\",\"type\":\"MIM\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"2345\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"118100\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"CERVICAL VERTEBRAL FUSION, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Alliance\",\"id\":\"Klippel-Feil+syndrome+1%2C+autosomal+dominant/8710\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"klippel-feil-syndrome\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"118100\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"symbol\"}"],"name":"Klippel-Feil syndrome 1, autosomal dominant","keywords":[],"content":"{\"Citation\":{\"@Abbrev\":\"GeneReviews\",\"@Type\":\"review\",\"ID\":[{\"$\":\"20301552\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"},{\"$\":\"NBK1378\",\"@Source\":\"BookShelf\"}]}}","id":"2445"}
