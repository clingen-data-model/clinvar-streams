The mnemonic CHARGE syndrome, introduced in the premolecular era, stands for coloboma, heart defect, choanal atresia, retarded growth and development, genital hypoplasia, ear anomalies (including deafness). Following the identification of the genetic cause of CHD7 disorder, the phenotypic spectrum expanded to include cranial nerve anomalies, vestibular defects, cleft lip and/or palate, hypothyroidism, tracheoesophageal anomalies, brain anomalies, seizures, and renal anomalies. Life expectancy highly depends on the severity of manifestations; mortality can be high in the first few years when severe birth defects (particularly complex heart defects) are present and often complicated by airway and feeding issues. In childhood, adolescence, and adulthood, decreased life expectancy is likely related to a combination of residual heart defects, infections, aspiration or choking, respiratory issues including obstructive and central apnea, and possibly seizures. Despite these complications, the life expectancy for many individuals can be normal.","xrefs":["{\"db\":\"MONDO\",\"id\":\"MONDO:0008965\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"214800\",\"type\":\"MIM\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"138\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"214800\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"CHARGE ASSOCIATION--COLOBOMA, HEART ANOMALY, CHOANAL ATRESIA, RETARDATION, GENITAL AND EAR ANOMALIES\"}","{\"db\":\"MONDO\",\"id\":\"MONDO:0008965\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"CHARGE syndrome\"}","{\"db\":\"Office of Rare Diseases\",\"id\":\"29\",\"ref_field\":\"gard_id\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Alliance\",\"id\":\"CHARGE+Syndrome/1315\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"SNOMED CT\",\"id\":\"47535005\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"GeneReviews\",\"id\":\"NBK1117\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}"],"type":"Disease","attribute_content":[]}
