{"id":"36468","alternate_symbols":[],"alternate_names":[],"keywords":[],"public_definition":"Cornelia de Lange syndrome is a developmental disorder that affects many parts of the body. The features of this disorder vary widely among affected individuals and range from relatively mild to severe.Cornelia de Lange syndrome is characterized by slow growth before and after birth leading to short stature; intellectual disability that is usually moderate to severe; and abnormalities of bones in the arms, hands, and fingers. Most people with Cornelia de Lange syndrome also have distinctive facial features, including arched eyebrows that often meet in the middle (synophrys), long eyelashes, low-set ears, small and widely spaced teeth, and a small and upturned nose. Many affected individuals also have behavior problems similar to autism, a developmental condition that affects communication and social interaction.Additional signs and symptoms of Cornelia de Lange syndrome can include excessive body hair (hypertrichosis), an unusually small head (microcephaly), hearing loss, and problems with the digestive tract. Some people with this condition are born with an opening in the roof of the mouth called a cleft palate. Seizures, heart defects, and eye problems have also been reported in people with this condition.","name":"Cornelia de Lange Syndrome","medgen_id":"CN239271","type":"Disease","attribute_content":[],"xrefs":["{\"db\":\"Illumina Clinical Services Laboratory,Illumina\",\"id\":\"551783\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"cornelia-de-lange-syndrome\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}"]}
