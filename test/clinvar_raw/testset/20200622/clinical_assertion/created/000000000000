Functional RNA studies have shown that this variant causes skipping of exon 15 (also reported as exon 14 in the literature) and this mutant transcript is expected to create a frameshift and a premature translation stop signal and be expressed as a truncated protein (PMID: 9298819, 15459959). Analysis of lymphoblastoid B cells from individuals carrying this variant has demonstrated the expression of the low-molecular-weight APC protein encoded by this mutant transcript (PMID: 9298819). This variant has been reported in more than 10 individuals affected with familial adenomatous polyposis (PMID: 8990002, 9298819, 10713886, 11247896, 15459959, 20223039, 20564245, 23159591). This variant has not been identified in the general population by the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD). Loss of APC function is a known mechanism of disease. Based on available evidence, this variant is classified as Pathogenic.\"}}","local_key":"Db4KrQBSZeoE7-orUyypkWwpVGx1c1bIDcxj4knx9gA|MedGen:C0027672","variation_archive_id":"VCV000156482","internal_id":"2651395","version":"1","date_last_updated":"2020-06-22","assertion_type":"variation to disease","trait_set_id":"13598","review_status":"criteria provided, single submitter","submission_names":["Color Genomics - ClinVar Submission - May2020 - SUB747"]}
