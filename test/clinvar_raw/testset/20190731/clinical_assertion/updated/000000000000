Also, at least 2 independent occurrences of this variant have been detected in patients with a RASopathy (PS4_Supporting; PMID: 22488832, 18247425, 23321623, 20949621, 16921267). This variant was absent from large population studies (PM2; ExAC, http://exac.broadinstitute.org). The p.Thr58Ile variant in HRAS is analogous to the same previously established amino acid change in the KRAS gene and the ClinGen RASopathy Expert Panel has defined that the pathogenicities of analogous variants in the HRAS and KRAS genes are correlated based on the assumption that a known functional residue in one gene is equivalent to other functions within that subgroup (PS1; 29493581). Furthermore, the variant is in a location that has been defined by the ClinGen RASopathy Expert Panel to be a mutational hotspot or domain of HRAS (PM1; PMID 29493581). The variant is in HRAS, which has been defined by the ClinGen RASopathy Expert Panel as a gene with low rate of benign missense with missense variants commonly being pathogenic (PP2; PMID 29493581). Computational prediction tools and conservation analysis suggest that the p.Thr58Ile variant may impact the protein (PP3). In summary, this variant meets criteria to be classified as pathogenic for RASopathies in an autosomal dominant manner.
