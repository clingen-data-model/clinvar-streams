Costello syndrome is typically characterized by failure to thrive in infancy as a result of severe postnatal feeding difficulties; short stature; developmental delay or intellectual disability; coarse facial features (full lips, large mouth, full nasal tip); curly or sparse, fine hair; loose, soft skin with deep palmar and plantar creases; papillomata of the face and perianal region; diffuse hypotonia and joint laxity with ulnar deviation of the wrists and fingers; tight Achilles tendons; and cardiac involvement including: cardiac hypertrophy (usually typical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy), congenital heart defect (usually valvar pulmonic stenosis), and arrhythmia (usually supraventricular tachycardia, especially chaotic atrial rhythm/multifocal atrial tachycardia or ectopic atrial tachycardia). Relative or absolute macrocephaly is typical, and postnatal cerebellar overgrowth can result in the development of a Chiari I malformation with associated anomalies including hydrocephalus or syringomyelia. Individuals with Costello syndrome have an approximately 15% lifetime risk for malignant tumors including rhabdomyosarcoma and neuroblastoma in young children and transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder in adolescents and young adults.","type":"Disease","symbol":"CSTLO","alternate_symbols":[],"alternate_names":[],"xrefs":["{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"218040\",\"type\":\"MIM\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"3071\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Alliance\",\"id\":\"Costello+Syndrome/1942\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"costello-syndrome\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Office of Rare Diseases\",\"id\":\"1550\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"SNOMED CT\",\"id\":\"309776008\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"GeneReviews\",\"id\":\"NBK1507\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"218040\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"symbol\"}"]}

FAP is a colon cancer predisposition syndrome in which hundreds to thousands of adenomatous colonic polyps develop, beginning, on average, at age 16 years (range 7-36 years). By age 35 years, 95% of individuals with FAP have polyps; without colectomy, colon cancer is inevitable. The mean age of colon cancer diagnosis in untreated individuals is 39 years (range 34-43 years). Extracolonic manifestations are variably present and include: polyps of the gastric fundus and duodenum, osteomas, dental anomalies, congenital hypertrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium (CHRPE), soft tissue tumors, desmoid tumors, and associated cancers. Attenuated FAP is characterized by multiple colonic polyps (average of 30), more proximally located polyps, and a diagnosis of colon cancer at a later age than in FAP. Certain extracolonic manifestations, such as gastric and duodenal polyps or cancers, are variably present in attenuated FAP; risk management may be substantially different between FAP and attenuated FAP. GAPPS is characterized by gastric fundic gland polyposis, increased risk of gastric cancer, and limited colonic involvement in most individuals reported.","type":"Disease","symbol":"FAP1","disease_mechanism":"loss of function","alternate_symbols":[],"alternate_names":["APC-Associated Polyposis Conditions","FAMILIAL ADENOMATOUS POLYPOSIS 1,
