Costello syndrome is typically characterized by failure to thrive in infancy as a result of severe postnatal feeding difficulties; short stature; developmental delay or intellectual disability; coarse facial features (full lips, large mouth, full nasal tip); curly or sparse, fine hair; loose, soft skin with deep palmar and plantar creases; papillomata of the face and perianal region; diffuse hypotonia and joint laxity with ulnar deviation of the wrists and fingers; tight Achilles tendons; and cardiac involvement including: cardiac hypertrophy (usually typical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy), congenital heart defect (usually valvar pulmonic stenosis), and arrhythmia (usually supraventricular tachycardia, especially chaotic atrial rhythm/multifocal atrial tachycardia or ectopic atrial tachycardia). Relative or absolute macrocephaly is typical, and postnatal cerebellar overgrowth can result in the development of a Chiari I malformation with associated anomalies including hydrocephalus or syringomyelia. Individuals with Costello syndrome have an approximately 15% lifetime risk for malignant tumors including rhabdomyosarcoma and neuroblastoma in young children and transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder in adolescents and young adults.","type":"Disease","symbol":"CSTLO","alternate_symbols":["CS"],"alternate_names":[],"xrefs":["{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"218040\",\"type\":\"MIM\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"3071\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Alliance\",\"id\":\"Costello+Syndrome/1942\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"costello-syndrome\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Office of Rare Diseases\",\"id\":\"1550\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"SNOMED CT\",\"id\":\"309776008\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"GeneReviews\",\"id\":\"NBK1507\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"218040\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"symbol\"}"]}
