This variant has been observed in multiple ethnic backgrounds with highest frequencies in individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry (3.6% Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD); rs1801155) and is present in ClinVar (ID: 822). Several large studies and meta-analyses have reported odds ratios 1.51-2.53 for developing colorectal cancer in Ashkenazi Jewish population (OR=1.51 [95% CI 1.16-1.98] Boursi 2013, OR=2.17 [95% CI 1.64-2.86] Liang 2013, OR=2.53 [95% CI 2.11-3.04] Leshno 2016). However, the cancer risk remains unknown in individuals of non-Jewish descent. This variant introduces a polyA(8) region that is subject to slippage during DNA replication, which increases the susceptibility for somatic changes (Laken 1997, Gryfe 1998). In summary, this variant is an established risk factor for colorectal cancer.\"}"],"date_last_updated":"2020-07-03","trait_set_id":"20218","rcv_accession_id":"RCV001195214"}
