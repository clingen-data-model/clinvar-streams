{"attribute_content":[],"keywords":[],"public_definition":"Nearsightedness, also known as myopia, is an eye condition that causes blurry distance vision. People who are nearsighted have more trouble seeing things that are far away (such as when driving) than things that are close up (such as when reading or using a computer). If it is not treated with corrective lenses or surgery, nearsightedness can lead to squinting, eyestrain, headaches, and significant visual impairment.Nearsightedness usually begins in childhood or adolescence. It tends to worsen with age until adulthood, when it may stop getting worse (stabilize). In some people, nearsightedness improves in later adulthood.For normal vision, light passes through the clear cornea at the front of the eye and is focused by the lens onto the surface of the retina, which is the lining of the back of the eye that contains light-sensing cells. People who are nearsighted typically have eyeballs that are too long from front to back. As a result, light entering the eye is focused too far forward, in front of the retina instead of on its surface. It is this change that causes distant objects to appear blurry. The longer the eyeball is, the farther forward light rays will be focused and the more severely nearsighted a person will be.Nearsightedness is measured by how powerful a lens must be to correct it. The standard unit of lens power is called a diopter. Negative (minus) powered lenses are used to correct nearsightedness. The more severe a person's nearsightedness, the larger the number of diopters required for correction. In an individual with nearsightedness, one eye may be more nearsighted than the other.Eye doctors often refer to nearsightedness less than -5 or -6 diopters as \"common myopia.\" Nearsightedness of -6 diopters or more is commonly called \"high myopia.\" This distinction is important because high myopia increases a person's risk of developing other eye problems that can lead to permanent vision loss or blindness. These problems include tearing and detachment of the retina, clouding of the lens (cataract), and an eye disease called glaucoma that is usually related to increased pressure within the eye. The risk of these other eye problems increases with the severity of the nearsightedness. The term \"pathological myopia\" is used to describe cases in which high myopia leads to tissue damage within the eye.","medgen_id":"C0027092","alternate_names":["Close sighted","Near sighted","Near sightedness","Nearsightedness"],"name":"Myopia","id":"18121","alternate_symbols":[],"type":"Disease","xrefs":["{\"db\":\"Human Phenotype Ontology\",\"id\":\"HP:0000545\",\"type\":\"primary\"}","{\"db\":\"Human Phenotype Ontology\",\"id\":\"HP:0001110\",\"type\":\"secondary\"}","{\"db\":\"Human Phenotype Ontology\",\"id\":\"HP:0007847\",\"type\":\"secondary\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"PS160700\",\"type\":\"Phenotypic series\"}","{\"db\":\"Human Phenotype Ontology\",\"id\":\"HP:0000545\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"Close sighted\"}","{\"db\":\"Human Phenotype Ontology\",\"id\":\"HP:0000545\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"Near sighted\"}","{\"db\":\"Human Phenotype Ontology\",\"id\":\"HP:0000545\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"Near sightedness\"}","{\"db\":\"Human Phenotype Ontology\",\"id\":\"HP:0000545\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"Nearsightedness\"}","{\"db\":\"Human Phenotype Ontology\",\"id\":\"HP:0000545\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"PS160700\",\"type\":\"Phenotypic series\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"nearsightedness\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}"]}

The kidneys become less able to function as this condition progresses, resulting in end-stage renal disease (ESRD).People with Alport syndrome frequently develop sensorineural hearing loss, which is caused by abnormalities of the inner ear, during late childhood or early adolescence. Affected individuals may also have misshapen lenses in the eyes (anterior lenticonus) and abnormal coloration of the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye (retina).

The impairment usually affects both ears and can be present at birth or begin in early childhood. Unless hearing is completely impaired at birth, the hearing problems worsen over time.Females with Perrault syndrome have abnormal or missing ovaries (ovarian dysgenesis), although their external genitalia are normal. Severely affected girls do not begin menstruation by age 16 (primary amenorrhea), and most never have a menstrual period. Less severely affected women have an early loss of ovarian function (primary ovarian insufficiency); their menstrual periods begin in adolescence, but they become less frequent and eventually stop before age 40. Women with Perrault syndrome may have difficulty conceiving or be unable to have biological children (infertile).Neurological problems in individuals with Perrault syndrome can include intellectual disability, difficulty with balance and coordinating movements (ataxia), and loss of sensation and weakness in the limbs (peripheral neuropathy).

In some affected individuals, the eyeball may appear to be completely missing; however, even in these cases some remaining eye tissue is generally present. Such severe microphthalmia should be distinguished from another condition called anophthalmia, in which no eyeball forms at all. However, the terms anophthalmia and severe microphthalmia are often used interchangeably. Microphthalmia may or may not result in significant vision loss.People with microphthalmia may also have a condition called coloboma. Colobomas are missing pieces of tissue in structures that form the eye. They may appear as notches or gaps in the colored part of the eye called the iris; the retina, which is the specialized light-sensitive tissue that lines the back of the eye; the blood vessel layer under the retina called the choroid; or in the optic nerves, which carry information from the eyes to the brain. Colobomas may be present in one or both eyes and, depending on their size and location, can affect a person's vision.People with microphthalmia may also have other eye abnormalities, including clouding of the lens of the eye (cataract) and a narrowed opening of the eye (narrowed palpebral fissure). Additionally, affected individuals may have an abnormality called microcornea, in which the clear front covering of the eye (cornea) is small and abnormally curved.Between one-third and one-half of affected individuals have microphthalmia as part of a syndrome that affects other organs and tissues in the body.

These corneal abnormalities, which worsen over time, can lead to nearsightedness (myopia), blurred vision that cannot be improved with corrective lenses (irregular astigmatism), and vision loss.Other corneal changes typical of keratoconus that can be seen during an eye exam include iron deposits in the cornea that form a yellow-to-brownish ring, called the Fleischer ring, surrounding the colored part of the eye (iris). Affected individuals may also develop Vogt's striae, which are thin, vertical, white lines in the tissue at the back of the cornea.Keratoconus may affect only one eye at first, but eventually the corneas of both eyes become misshapen, although they might not be affected with the same severity. As keratoconus worsens, people with this condition can develop corneal scarring, often caused by exposure of the abnormally thin cornea to prolonged contact lens use or excessive eye rubbing.The eye changes characteristic of keratoconus typically begin in adolescence and slowly worsen until mid-adulthood at which point the shape of the cornea remains stable.","medgen_id":"C0022578","alternate_names":["Bulging cornea","Conical cornea"],"name":"Keratoconus","id":"6402","alternate_symbols":[],"type":"Disease","xrefs":["{\"db\":\"Human Phenotype Ontology\",\"id\":\"HP:0000563\",\"type\":\"primary\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"PS148300\",\"type\":\"Phenotypic series\"}","{\"db\":\"Human Phenotype Ontology\",\"id\":\"HP:0000563\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"Bulging cornea\"}","{\"db\":\"Human Phenotype Ontology\",\"id\":\"HP:0000563\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"Conical cornea\"}","{\"db\":\"Human Phenotype Ontology\",\"id\":\"HP:0000563\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"PS148300\",\"type\":\"Phenotypic series\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Office of Rare Diseases\",\"id\":\"6824\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"SNOMED CT\",\"id\":\"65636009\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"keratoconus\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}","{\"db\":\"Office of Rare Diseases\",\"id\":\"6824\",\"ref_field\":\"symbol\"}"]}

{"attribute_content":[],"keywords":[],"public_definition":"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a condition that appears very early in childhood development, varies in severity, and is characterized by impaired social skills, communication problems, and repetitive behaviors. These difficulties can interfere with affected individuals' ability to function in social, academic, and employment settings. People with ASD also have an increased risk of psychiatric problems such as anxiety, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and eating disorders.From as early as 1 to 2 years of age, people with ASD have an impaired ability to interact with other people; they are often more comfortable dealing with objects. Affected individuals have difficulty understanding and using non-verbal social cues such as eye contact, facial expressions, gestures, and body language. Inability to recognize and use these cues makes it hard for affected individuals to understand the feelings of others or communicate their own feelings appropriately. Behavioral signs of ASD, such as reduced eye contact and social interaction, can sometimes be detected before age 2. However, the condition is usually diagnosed between ages 2 and 4, when more advanced communication and social skills, such as learning to play with others, typically begin to develop.Repetitive behaviors in ASD can include simple actions such as rocking, hand-flapping, or repetition of words or noises (echolalia). Affected individuals often dwell on or repeatedly express particular thoughts; this behavior is called perseveration. People with ASD tend to be rigid about their established routines and may strongly resist disruptions such as changes in schedule. They may also have difficulty tolerating sensory stimuli such as loud noises or bright lights.While social and communication difficulties and unusual behaviors define ASD, affected individuals can have a wide range of intellectual abilities and language skills. A majority of people with ASD have mild to moderate intellectual disability, while others have average to above-average intelligence. Some have particular cognitive abilities that greatly surpass their overall level of functioning, often in areas such as music, mathematics, or memory.Some people with ASD do not speak at all, while others use language fluently. However, fluent speakers with ASD often have problems associated with verbal communication. They might speak in a monotone voice, have unusual vocal mannerisms, or choose unusual topics of conversation.Several diagnoses that used to be classified as separate conditions are now grouped together under the diagnosis of ASD. For example, autistic disorder was a term that was used when affected individuals had limited or absent verbal communication, often in combination with intellectual disability. By contrast, Asperger syndrome was a diagnosis formerly applied to affected individuals of average or above-average intelligence who were not delayed in their language development. The broader diagnosis of ASD was established because many affected individuals fall outside of the strict definitions of the narrower diagnoses, and their intellectual and communication abilities may change over time. However, some individuals who were previously diagnosed with one of the subtypes now do not meet all the criteria of the new umbrella diagnosis.","medgen_id":"C0524528","alternate_names":[],"name":"Rare pervasive developmental disorder","id":"41337","alternate_symbols":[],"type":"Disease","xrefs":["{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"168778\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"168778\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"autism-spectrum-disorder\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}"]}

{"attribute_content":[],"keywords":[],"public_definition":"Mosaic variegated aneuploidy (MVA) syndrome is a rare disorder in which some cells in the body have an abnormal number of chromosomes instead of the usual 46 chromosomes, a situation known as aneuploidy. Most commonly, cells have an extra chromosome, which is called trisomy, or are missing a chromosome, which is known as monosomy. In MVA syndrome, some cells are aneuploid and others have the normal number of chromosomes, which is a phenomenon known as mosaicism. Typically, at least one-quarter of cells in affected individuals have an abnormal number of chromosomes. Because the additional or missing chromosomes vary among the abnormal cells, the aneuploidy is described as variegated.In MVA syndrome, growth before birth is slow (intrauterine growth restriction). After birth, affected individuals continue to grow at a slow rate and are shorter than average. In addition, they typically have an unusually small head size (microcephaly). Another common feature of MVA syndrome is an increased risk of developing cancer in childhood. Cancers that occur most frequently in affected individuals include a cancer of muscle tissue called rhabdomyosarcoma, a form of kidney cancer known as Wilms tumor, and a cancer of the blood-forming tissue known as leukemia.Less commonly, people with MVA syndrome have eye abnormalities or distinctive facial features, such as a broad nasal bridge and low-set ears. Some affected individuals have brain abnormalities, the most common of which is called Dandy-Walker malformation. Intellectual disability, seizures, and other health problems can also occur in people with MVA syndrome.There are at least three types of MVA syndrome, each with a different genetic cause. Type 1 is the most common and displays the classic signs and symptoms described above. Type 2 appears to have slightly different signs and symptoms than type 1, although the small number of affected individuals makes it difficult to define its characteristic features. Individuals with MVA syndrome type 2 grow slowly before and after birth; however, their head size is typically normal. Some people with MVA syndrome type 2 have unusually short arms. Individuals with MVA syndrome type 2 do not seem to have an increased risk of cancer. Another form of MVA syndrome is characterized by a high risk of developing Wilms tumor.

The signs and symptoms of SLE vary among affected individuals, and can involve many organs and systems, including the skin, joints, kidneys, lungs, central nervous system, and blood-forming (hematopoietic) system. SLE is one of a large group of conditions called autoimmune disorders that occur when the immune system attacks the body's own tissues and organs.SLE may first appear as extreme tiredness (fatigue), a vague feeling of discomfort or illness (malaise), fever, loss of appetite, and weight loss. Most affected individuals also have joint pain, typically affecting the same joints on both sides of the body, and muscle pain and weakness. Skin problems are common in SLE. A characteristic feature is a flat red rash across the cheeks and bridge of the nose, called a \"butterfly rash\" because of its shape. The rash, which generally does not hurt or itch, often appears or becomes more pronounced when exposed to sunlight. Other skin problems that may occur in SLE include calcium deposits under the skin (calcinosis), damaged blood vessels (vasculitis) in the skin, and tiny red spots called petechiae. Petechiae are caused by a shortage of cells involved in clotting (platelets), which leads to bleeding under the skin. Affected individuals may also have hair loss (alopecia) and open sores (ulcerations) in the moist lining (mucosae) of the mouth, nose, or, less commonly, the genitals.About a third of people with SLE develop kidney disease (nephritis). Heart problems may also occur in SLE, including inflammation of the sac-like membrane around the heart (pericarditis) and abnormalities of the heart valves, which control blood flow in the heart. Heart disease caused by fatty buildup in the blood vessels (atherosclerosis), which is very common in the general population, is even more common in people with SLE. The inflammation characteristic of SLE can also damage the nervous system, and may result in abnormal sensation and weakness in the limbs (peripheral neuropathy); seizures; stroke; and difficulty processing, learning, and remembering information (cognitive impairment). Anxiety and depression are also common in SLE.People with SLE have episodes in which the condition gets worse (exacerbations) and other times when it gets better (remissions). Overall, SLE gradually gets worse over time, and damage to the major organs of the body can be life-threatening.","medgen_id":"C2677096","alternate_names":["SYSTEMIC LUPUS ERYTHEMATOSUS, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, 11"],"name":"Systemic lupus erythematosus 11","id":"4237","alternate_symbols":[],"type":"Disease","xrefs":["{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"612253\",\"type\":\"MIM\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"600558.0001\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"SYSTEMIC LUPUS ERYTHEMATOSUS, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, 11\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"612253\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"SYSTEMIC LUPUS ERYTHEMATOSUS, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, 11\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"systemic-lupus-erythematosus\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"612253\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"symbol\"}"]}

{"attribute_content":[],"keywords":[],"public_definition":"Usher syndrome is a condition characterized by partial or total hearing loss and vision loss that worsens over time. The hearing loss is classified as sensorineural, which means that it is caused by abnormalities of the inner ear. The loss of vision is caused by an eye disease called retinitis pigmentosa (RP), which affects the layer of light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye (the retina). Vision loss occurs as the light-sensing cells of the retina gradually deteriorate. Night vision loss begins first, followed by blind spots that develop in the side (peripheral) vision. Over time, these blind spots enlarge and merge to produce tunnel vision. In some cases, vision is further impaired by clouding of the lens of the eye (cataracts). However, many people with retinitis pigmentosa retain some central vision throughout their lives.Researchers have identified three major types of Usher syndrome, designated as types I, II, and III. These types are distinguished by the severity of hearing loss, the presence or absence of balance problems, and the age at which signs and symptoms appear. The types are further divided into subtypes based on their genetic cause.Most individuals with Usher syndrome type I are born with severe to profound hearing loss. Progressive vision loss caused by retinitis pigmentosa becomes apparent in childhood. This type of Usher syndrome also causes abnormalities of the vestibular system, which is the part of the inner ear that helps maintain the body's balance and orientation in space. As a result of the vestibular abnormalities, children with the condition have trouble with balance. They begin sitting independently and walking later than usual, and they may have difficulty riding a bicycle and playing certain sports.Usher syndrome type II is characterized by hearing loss from birth and progressive vision loss that begins in adolescence or adulthood. The hearing loss associated with this form of Usher syndrome ranges from mild to severe and mainly affects the ability to hear high-frequency sounds. For example, it is difficult for affected individuals to hear high, soft speech sounds, such as those of the letters d and t. The degree of hearing loss varies within and among families with this condition, and it may become more severe over time. Unlike the other forms of Usher syndrome, type II is not associated with vestibular abnormalities that cause difficulties with balance.People with Usher syndrome type III experience hearing loss and vision loss beginning somewhat later in life. Unlike the other forms of Usher syndrome, type III is usually associated with normal hearing at birth. Hearing loss typically begins during late childhood or adolescence, after the development of speech, and becomes more severe over time. By middle age, most affected individuals have profound hearing loss. Vision loss caused by retinitis pigmentosa also develops in late childhood or adolescence. Some people with Usher syndrome type III develop vestibular abnormalities that cause problems with balance.","medgen_id":"C0271097","alternate_names":["Usher Syndromes"],"name":"Usher syndrome","disease_mechanism":"loss of function","id":"38085","alternate_symbols":[],"type":"Disease","disease_mechanism_id":"273","xrefs":["{\"db\":\"MeSH\",\"id\":\"D052245\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"PS276900\",\"type\":\"Phenotypic series\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"886\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000561956\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"usher-syndrome\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"PS276900\",\"type\":\"Phenotypic series\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"886\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"usher-syndrome\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}"]}

{"attribute_content":[],"keywords":[],"public_definition":"Oculocutaneous albinism is a group of conditions that affect coloring (pigmentation) of the skin, hair, and eyes. Affected individuals typically have very fair skin and white or light-colored hair. Long-term sun exposure greatly increases the risk of skin damage and skin cancers, including an aggressive form of skin cancer called melanoma, in people with this condition. Oculocutaneous albinism also reduces pigmentation of the colored part of the eye (the iris) and the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye (the retina). People with this condition usually have vision problems such as reduced sharpness; rapid, involuntary eye movements (nystagmus); and increased sensitivity to light (photophobia).Researchers have identified multiple types of oculocutaneous albinism, which are distinguished by their specific skin, hair, and eye color changes and by their genetic cause. Oculocutaneous albinism type 1 is characterized by white hair, very pale skin, and light-colored irises. Type 2 is typically less severe than type 1; the skin is usually a creamy white color and hair may be light yellow, blond, or light brown. Type 3 includes a form of albinism called rufous oculocutaneous albinism, which usually affects dark-skinned people. Affected individuals have reddish-brown skin, ginger or red hair, and hazel or brown irises. Type 3 is often associated with milder vision abnormalities than the other forms of oculocutaneous albinism. Type 4 has signs and symptoms similar to those seen with type 2.Several additional types of this disorder have been proposed, each affecting one or a few families.","medgen_id":"C0078918","alternate_names":[],"name":"Oculocutaneous albinism","id":"17998","alternate_symbols":[],"type":"Disease","xrefs":["{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"PS203100\",\"type\":\"Phenotypic series\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"55\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"PS203100\",\"type\":\"Phenotypic series\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"SNOMED CT\",\"id\":\"63844009\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"oculocutaneous-albinism\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}"]}

Complex I is found in cell structures called mitochondria, which convert the energy from food into a form that cells can use. Complex I is the first of five mitochondrial complexes that carry out a multi-step process called oxidative phosphorylation, through which cells derive much of their energy.Mitochondrial complex I deficiency can cause a wide variety of signs and symptoms affecting many organs and systems of the body, particularly the nervous system, the heart, and the muscles used for movement (skeletal muscles). These signs and symptoms can appear at any time from birth to adulthood.People with mitochondrial complex I deficiency typically have neurological problems, such as abnormal brain function (encephalopathy), recurrent seizures (epilepsy), intellectual disability, difficulty coordinating movements (ataxia), or involuntary movements (dystonia). Affected individuals may have low muscle tone (hypotonia), muscle pain (myalgia), and extreme fatigue in response to physical activity (exercise intolerance). They tend to develop elevated levels of lactic acid in the blood (lactic acidosis), which can cause nausea, vomiting, weakness, and rapid breathing. In severe cases, lactic acidosis can be life-threatening.People with mitochondrial complex I deficiency sometimes have heart, liver, or kidney problems. Vision problems due to abnormal eye movement or breakdown (degeneration) of the nerves that carry signals from the eyes to the brain (optic nerves) can also occur.Some people with mitochondrial complex I deficiency have groups of signs and symptoms that are classified as a specific syndrome. For example, a condition called Leigh syndrome is most commonly caused by mitochondrial complex I deficiency. Leigh syndrome is characterized by progressive loss of mental and movement abilities (developmental or psychomotor regression) and typically results in death within 2 to 3 years from the onset of symptoms. Another condition that can be caused by mitochondrial complex I deficiency, Leber hereditary optic neuropathy, is associated mainly with vision problems due to optic nerve degeneration. These syndromes can also have other causes.","medgen_id":"C2936907","alternate_names":[],"name":"Mitochondrial complex I deficiency","id":"3208","alternate_symbols":[],"type":"Disease","xrefs":["{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"2609\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Alliance\",\"id\":\"Mitochondrial+complex+I+deficiency/4823\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Office of Rare Diseases\",\"id\":\"3908\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"mitochondrial-complex-i-deficiency\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}"]}

These disorders affect the retina, which is the layer of light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye. In people with cone-rod dystrophy, vision loss occurs as the light-sensing cells of the retina gradually deteriorate.The first signs and symptoms of cone-rod dystrophy, which often occur in childhood, are usually decreased sharpness of vision (visual acuity) and increased sensitivity to light (photophobia). These features are typically followed by impaired color vision (dyschromatopsia), blind spots (scotomas) in the center of the visual field, and partial side (peripheral) vision loss. Over time, affected individuals develop night blindness and a worsening of their peripheral vision, which can limit independent mobility. Decreasing visual acuity makes reading increasingly difficult and most affected individuals are legally blind by mid-adulthood. As the condition progresses, individuals may develop involuntary eye movements (nystagmus).There are more than 30 types of cone-rod dystrophy, which are distinguished by their genetic cause and their pattern of inheritance: autosomal recessive, autosomal dominant, and X-linked. Additionally, cone-rod dystrophy can occur alone without any other signs and symptoms or it can occur as part of a syndrome that affects multiple parts of the body.","medgen_id":"CN231743","alternate_names":[],"name":"Cone-rod dystrophy 21","id":"33616","alternate_symbols":["DRAM2"],"type":"Disease","xrefs":["{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"616502\",\"type\":\"MIM\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"1872\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"cone-rod-dystrophy\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"616502\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"symbol\"}"]}

{"attribute_content":[],"keywords":[],"public_definition":"Mucopolysaccharidosis type III (MPS III), also known as Sanfilippo syndrome, is a progressive disorder that primarily affects the brain and spinal cord (central nervous system). It is characterized by deterioration of neurological function (neurodegeneration), resulting in many of the features of the condition. Other body systems can also be involved, although the physical features are usually mild in the early stages.People with MPS III generally do not display any features of the condition at birth, but they begin to show signs and symptoms of the disorder during early childhood. Affected children often initially have delayed speech and behavior problems. They may become restless, destructive, anxious, or aggressive, and some display features of autism spectrum disorder, which is a condition characterized by difficulty with social interactions and communication. Sleep disturbances are also very common in children with MPS III. This condition causes progressive intellectual disability and the loss of previously acquired skills (developmental regression). In later stages of the disorder, people with MPS III may develop seizures and movement disorders.The physical features of MPS III are less pronounced than those of other types of mucopolysaccharidosis. Individuals with MPS III typically have mildly \"coarse\" facial features, a large head (macrocephaly), a slightly enlarged liver (mild hepatomegaly), and a soft out-pouching around the belly-button (umbilical hernia) or lower abdomen (inguinal hernia). Some people with MPS III have short stature, joint stiffness, or mild dysostosis multiplex, which refers to multiple skeletal abnormalities seen on x-ray. Affected individuals often experience chronic diarrhea and recurrent upper respiratory and ear infections. People with MPS III may also have hearing loss and vision problems.MPS III is divided into types IIIA, IIIB, IIIC, and IIID, which are distinguished by their genetic cause. The different types of MPS III have similar signs and symptoms, although the features of MPS IIIA typically appear earlier in life and progress more rapidly. People with MPS III usually live into adolescence or early adulthood.","medgen_id":"C0026706","alternate_names":[],"name":"Sanfilippo syndrome","id":"6283","alternate_symbols":["MPS III"],"type":"Disease","xrefs":["{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"581\"}","{\"db\":\"Office of Rare Diseases\",\"id\":\"3807\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"SNOMED CT\",\"id\":\"88393000\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"mucopolysaccharidosis-type-iii\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}"]}

{"attribute_content":[],"keywords":[],"public_definition":"Crohn disease is a complex, long-lasting (chronic) disorder that primarily affects the digestive system. This condition involves an abnormal immune response that causes excess inflammation. It most often affects the intestinal walls, particularly in the lower part of the small intestine (the ileum) and portions of the large intestine (the colon). However, inflammation can occur in any part of the digestive system, from the mouth to the anus. The inflamed tissues become thick and swollen, and the inner surfaces of the digestive system may develop open sores (ulcers).Crohn disease most commonly appears in a person's late teens or twenties, although the disease can begin at any age. Signs and symptoms tend to flare up multiple times throughout life. The most common features of this condition are persistent diarrhea, abdominal pain and cramping, loss of appetite, weight loss, and fever. Some people with Crohn disease have blood in the stool from inflamed tissues in the intestine; over time, chronic bleeding can lead to a low number of red blood cells (anemia). In some cases, Crohn disease can also cause inflammation affecting the joints, eyes, or skin.Intestinal blockage is a common complication of Crohn disease. Blockages are caused by swelling or a buildup of scar tissue in the intestinal walls. Some affected individuals also develop fistulae, which are abnormal connections between the intestine and other tissues. Fistulae occur when ulcers break through the intestinal wall and passages form between loops of the intestine or between the intestine and nearby structures (such as the bladder, vagina, or skin).Crohn disease is one common form of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Another type of IBD, ulcerative colitis, also causes chronic inflammation of the intestinal lining. Unlike Crohn disease, which can affect any part of the digestive system, ulcerative colitis typically causes inflammation only in the colon.","medgen_id":"CN043071","alternate_names":[],"name":"Crohn disease","id":"8962","alternate_symbols":[],"type":"Disease","xrefs":["{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"crohn-disease\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"crohn-disease\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}"]}

Other characteristic features of this condition are underdeveloped or missing kneecaps (patellae), small ears, and, often, an abnormally small head (microcephaly). Despite a small head size, most people with Meier-Gorlin syndrome have normal intellect.Some people with Meier-Gorlin syndrome have other skeletal abnormalities, such as unusually narrow long bones in the arms and legs, a deformity of the knee joint that allows the knee to bend backwards (genu recurvatum), and slowed mineralization of bones (delayed bone age).Most people with Meier-Gorlin syndrome have distinctive facial features. In addition to being abnormally small, the ears may be low-set or rotated backward. Additional features can include a small mouth (microstomia), an underdeveloped lower jaw (micrognathia), full lips, and a narrow nose with a high nasal bridge.Abnormalities in sexual development may also occur in Meier-Gorlin syndrome. In some males with this condition, the testes are small or undescended (cryptorchidism). Affected females may have unusually small external genital folds (hypoplasia of the labia majora) and small breasts.

{"attribute_content":[],"keywords":[],"symbol":"CMTDID","public_definition":"Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease encompasses a group of disorders called hereditary sensory and motor neuropathies that damage the peripheral nerves. Peripheral nerves connect the brain and spinal cord to muscles and to sensory cells that detect sensations such as touch, pain, heat, and sound. Damage to the peripheral nerves that worsens over time can result in alteration or loss of sensation and wasting (atrophy) of muscles in the feet, legs, and hands.Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease usually becomes apparent in adolescence or early adulthood, but onset may occur anytime from early childhood through late adulthood. Symptoms of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease vary in severity and age of onset even among members of the same family. Some people never realize they have the disorder because their symptoms are so mild, but most have a moderate amount of physical disability. A small percentage of people experience severe weakness or other problems which, in very rare cases, can be life-threatening. In most affected individuals, however, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease does not affect life expectancy.Typically, the earliest symptoms of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease result from muscle atrophy in the feet. Affected individuals may have foot abnormalities such as high arches (pes cavus), flat feet (pes planus), or curled toes (hammer toes). They often have difficulty flexing the foot or walking on the heel of the foot. These difficulties may cause a higher than normal step (steppage gait) and increase the risk of ankle injuries and tripping. As the disease worsens, muscles in the lower legs usually weaken, but leg and foot problems rarely require the use of a wheelchair.Affected individuals may also develop weakness in the hands, causing difficulty with daily activities such as writing, fastening buttons, and turning doorknobs. People with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease typically experience a decreased sensitivity to touch, heat, and cold in the feet and lower legs, but occasionally feel aching or burning sensations. In rare cases, affected individuals have loss of vision or gradual hearing loss that sometimes leads to deafness.There are several types of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, which are differentiated by their effects on nerve cells and patterns of inheritance. Type 1 (CMT1) is characterized by abnormalities in myelin, the fatty substance that covers nerve cells, protecting them and helping to transmit nerve impulses. These abnormalities slow the transmission of nerve impulses and can affect the health of the nerve fiber. Type 2 (CMT2) is characterized by abnormalities in the fiber, or axon, that extends from a nerve cell body to muscles or to sense organs. These abnormalities reduce the strength of the nerve impulse. In forms of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease classified as intermediate type, the nerve impulses are both slowed and reduced in strength, probably due to abnormalities in both myelin and axons. Type 4 (CMT4) is distinguished from the other types by its pattern of inheritance; it can affect either the axons or the myelin. Type X Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMTX) is caused by mutations in genes on the X chromosome, one of the two sex chromosomes. Within the various types of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, subtypes (such as CMT1A, CMT1B, CMT2A, CMT4A, and CMTX1) indicate different genetic causes.Sometimes other, historical names are used to refer to particular forms of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. For example, Roussy-Levy syndrome is a form of CMT11 with the additional feature of rhythmic shaking (tremors). Dejerine-Sottas syndrome is a term sometimes used to describe a severe, early childhood form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease; it is also sometimes called type 3 (CMT3). Depending on the specific gene that is altered, this severe, early-onset form of the disorder may also be classified as CMT1 or CMT4. CMTX5 is also known as Rosenberg-Chutorian syndrome.","medgen_id":"C1843075","alternate_names":["CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH DISEASE, DOMINANT INTERMEDIATE D","CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH NEUROPATHY, DOMINANT INTERMEDIATE D"],"name":"Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease dominant intermediate 3","id":"1419","alternate_symbols":["CMT2I","CMT2J","DI-CMTD"],"type":"Disease","xrefs":["{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"607791\",\"type\":\"MIM\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"159440.0018\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH DISEASE, DOMINANT INTERMEDIATE D\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"607791\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH DISEASE, DOMINANT INTERMEDIATE D\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"607791\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH NEUROPATHY, DOMINANT INTERMEDIATE D\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"607791\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_symbols\",\"ref_field_element\":\"DI-CMTD\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Alliance\",\"id\":\"Charcot-Marie-Tooth+Disease+Dominant+Intermediate+3/1280\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Office of Rare Diseases\",\"id\":\"9207\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"charcot-marie-tooth-disease\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"607791\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"symbol\"}"]}

Distinctive facial features can include widely spaced eyes (hypertelorism), large eyelid openings, droopy eyelids (ptosis), high-arched eyebrows, a broad nasal bridge and tip of the nose, a long space between the nose and upper lip (philtrum), full cheeks, and a pointed chin.Structural brain abnormalities are also present in most people with Baraitser-Winter syndrome. These abnormalities are related to impaired neuronal migration, a process by which nerve cells (neurons) move to their proper positions in the developing brain. The most frequent brain abnormality associated with Baraitser-Winter syndrome is pachygyria, which is an area of the brain that has an abnormally smooth surface with fewer folds and grooves. Less commonly, affected individuals have lissencephaly, which is similar to pachygyria but involves the entire brain surface. These structural changes can cause mild to severe intellectual disability, developmental delay, and seizures.Other features of Baraitser-Winter syndrome can include short stature, ear abnormalities and hearing loss, heart defects, presence of an extra (duplicated) thumb, and abnormalities of the kidneys and urinary system. Some affected individuals have limited movement of large joints, such as the elbows and knees, which may be present at birth or develop over time. Rarely, people with Baraitser-Winter syndrome have involuntary muscle tensing (dystonia).","medgen_id":"C1853623","alternate_names":["CEREBROOCULOFACIAL LYMPHATIC SYNDROME","CHROMOSOME 7p22 DELETION SYNDROME","COFL SYNDROME","Fryns-Aftimos syndrome","MENTAL RETARDATION WITH EPILEPSY AND CHARACTERISTIC FACIES","PACHYGYRIA, MENTAL RETARDATION, EPILEPSY, AND CHARACTERISTIC FACIES"],"name":"Baraitser-Winter syndrome","id":"40721","alternate_symbols":[],"type":"Disease","xrefs":["{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"PS243310\",\"type\":\"Phenotypic series\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"2995\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"606155\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"CEREBROOCULOFACIAL LYMPHATIC SYNDROME\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"243310\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"CHROMOSOME 7p22 DELETION SYNDROME\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"606155\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"COFL SYNDROME\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"606155\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"MENTAL RETARDATION WITH EPILEPSY AND CHARACTERISTIC FACIES\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"606155\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"PACHYGYRIA, MENTAL RETARDATION, EPILEPSY, AND CHARACTERISTIC FACIES\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"PS243310\",\"type\":\"Phenotypic series\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"SNOMED CT\",\"id\":\"702410002\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"baraitser-winter-syndrome\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}"]}

This form of diabetes is characterized by high blood sugar levels (hyperglycemia) resulting from a shortage of the hormone insulin. Insulin controls how much glucose (a type of sugar) is passed from the blood into cells for conversion to energy.Individuals with permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus experience slow growth before birth (intrauterine growth retardation). Affected infants have hyperglycemia and an excessive loss of fluids (dehydration) and are unable to gain weight and grow at the expected rate (failure to thrive).In some cases, people with permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus also have certain neurological problems, including developmental delay and recurrent seizures (epilepsy). This combination of developmental delay, epilepsy, and neonatal diabetes is called DEND syndrome. Intermediate DEND syndrome is a similar combination but with milder developmental delay and without epilepsy.A small number of individuals with permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus have an underdeveloped pancreas. Because the pancreas produces digestive enzymes as well as secreting insulin and other hormones, affected individuals experience digestive problems such as fatty stools and an inability to absorb fat-soluble vitamins.","medgen_id":"C3891828","alternate_names":["PANCREATIC HYPOPLASIA, CONGENITAL","Pancreatic agenesis, congenital"],"name":"Pancreatic agenesis 1","id":"3259","alternate_symbols":[],"type":"Disease","xrefs":["{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"260370\",\"type\":\"MIM\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"2805\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"260370\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"PANCREATIC HYPOPLASIA, CONGENITAL\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Alliance\",\"id\":\"Pancreatic+agenesis%2C+congenital/9067\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"Pancreatic agenesis, congenital\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"permanent-neonatal-diabetes-mellitus\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"260370\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"symbol\"}"]}

{"attribute_content":[],"keywords":[],"public_definition":"Anauxetic dysplasia is a disorder characterized by extremely short stature (dwarfism) and other skeletal abnormalities, an unusually large range of joint movement (hypermobility), dental problems, and distinctive facial features. Mild intellectual disability can also occur in this disorder.People with anauxetic dysplasia have dwarfism with unusually short limbs for their height (disproportionate short stature) beginning before birth. Dislocation of the bones at the top of the spine (atlantoaxial subluxation) can also occur in this disorder, and may cause pinching (compression) of the spinal cord. As a result, affected individuals may experience neurological symptoms including pain, tingling, numbness, coordination problems, weakness, and paralysis. In severe cases, the spinal cord compression may lead to paralysis of the muscles needed for breathing, which can be life-threatening during early childhood.Other skeletal abnormalities in anauxetic dysplasia include a barrel-shaped chest and a rounded upper back that also curves to the side (kyphoscoliosis). Without surgical correction, the kyphoscoliosis can constrict the lungs and cause difficulty breathing. People with anauxetic dysplasia can also have an exaggerated curvature of the lower back (hyperlordosis), dislocation of the hips, and soles of the feet that are rounded outward (rocker-bottom feet).Typical facial features in anauxetic dysplasia include closely spaced eyes (hypotelorism), a flat or sunken appearance of the middle of the face (midface hypoplasia), an unusually large tongue (macroglossia), and a protruding chin (prognathism). Affected individuals can also have fewer teeth than normal (hypodontia).","medgen_id":"C1846796","alternate_names":["SPONDYLOEPIMETAPHYSEAL DYSPLASIA, ANAUXETIC TYPE","SPONDYLOMETAEPIPHYSEAL DYSPLASIA, ANAUXETIC TYPE"],"name":"Anauxetic dysplasia","id":"37896","alternate_symbols":["ANXD"],"type":"Disease","xrefs":["{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"PS607095\",\"type\":\"Phenotypic series\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"93347\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"607095\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"SPONDYLOEPIMETAPHYSEAL DYSPLASIA, ANAUXETIC TYPE\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"607095\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"SPONDYLOMETAEPIPHYSEAL DYSPLASIA, ANAUXETIC TYPE\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"607095\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_symbols\",\"ref_field_element\":\"ANXD\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Alliance\",\"id\":\"Anauxetic+Dysplasia/425\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"PS607095\",\"type\":\"Phenotypic series\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Office of Rare Diseases\",\"id\":\"9657\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"anauxetic-dysplasia\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}"]}

{"attribute_content":[],"keywords":[],"public_definition":"Bartter syndrome is a group of very similar kidney disorders that cause an imbalance of potassium, sodium, chloride, and related molecules in the body.In some cases, Bartter syndrome becomes apparent before birth. The disorder can cause polyhydramnios, which is an increased volume of fluid surrounding the fetus (amniotic fluid). Polyhydramnios increases the risk of premature birth.Beginning in infancy, affected individuals often fail to grow and gain weight at the expected rate (failure to thrive). They lose excess amounts of salt (sodium chloride) in their urine, which leads to dehydration, constipation, and increased urine production (polyuria). In addition, large amounts of calcium are lost through the urine (hypercalciuria), which can cause weakening of the bones (osteopenia). Some of the calcium is deposited in the kidneys as they are concentrating urine, leading to hardening of the kidney tissue (nephrocalcinosis). Bartter syndrome is also characterized by low levels of potassium in the blood (hypokalemia), which can result in muscle weakness, cramping, and fatigue. Rarely, affected children develop hearing loss caused by abnormalities in the inner ear (sensorineural deafness).Two major forms of Bartter syndrome are distinguished by their age of onset and severity. One form begins before birth (antenatal) and is often life-threatening. The other form, often called the classical form, begins in early childhood and tends to be less severe. Once the genetic causes of Bartter syndrome were identified, researchers also split the disorder into different types based on the genes involved. Types I, II, and IV have the features of antenatal Bartter syndrome. Because type IV is also associated with hearing loss, it is sometimes called antenatal Bartter syndrome with sensorineural deafness. Type III usually has the features of classical Bartter syndrome.","medgen_id":"C0004775","alternate_names":["Bartter's syndrome"],"name":"Bartter syndrome","id":"6253","alternate_symbols":[],"type":"Disease","xrefs":["{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"PS601678\",\"type\":\"Phenotypic series\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"112\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Alliance\",\"id\":\"Bartter%27s+Syndrome/750\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"Bartter's syndrome\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"bartter-syndrome\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"PS601678\",\"type\":\"Phenotypic series\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Office of Rare Diseases\",\"id\":\"5893\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"bartter-syndrome\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}"]}

{"attribute_content":[],"keywords":[],"public_definition":"Centronuclear myopathy is a condition characterized by muscle weakness (myopathy) and wasting (atrophy) in the skeletal muscles, which are the muscles used for movement. The severity of centronuclear myopathy varies among affected individuals, even among members of the same family.People with centronuclear myopathy begin experiencing muscle weakness at any time from birth to early adulthood. The muscle weakness slowly worsens over time and can lead to delayed development of motor skills, such as crawling or walking; muscle pain during exercise; and difficulty walking. Some affected individuals may need wheelchair assistance as the muscles atrophy and weakness becomes more severe. In rare instances, the muscle weakness improves over time.Some people with centronuclear myopathy experience mild to severe breathing problems related to the weakness of muscles needed for breathing. People with centronuclear myopathy may have droopy eyelids (ptosis) and weakness in other facial muscles, including the muscles that control eye movement. People with this condition may also have foot abnormalities, a high arch in the roof of the mouth (high-arched palate), and abnormal side-to-side curvature of the spine (scoliosis). Rarely, individuals with centronuclear myopathy have a weakened heart muscle (cardiomyopathy), disturbances in nerve function (neuropathy), or intellectual disability.A key feature of centronuclear myopathy is the displacement of the nucleus in muscle cells, which can be viewed under a microscope. Normally the nucleus is found at the edges of the rod-shaped muscle cells, but in people with centronuclear myopathy the nucleus is located in the center of these cells.

{"attribute_content":[],"keywords":[],"symbol":"SOTOS","public_definition":"Sotos syndrome is a disorder characterized by a distinctive facial appearance, overgrowth in childhood, and learning disabilities or delayed development of mental and movement abilities. Characteristic facial features include a long, narrow face; a high forehead; flushed (reddened) cheeks; and a small, pointed chin. In addition, the outside corners of the eyes may point downward (down-slanting palpebral fissures). This facial appearance is most notable in early childhood. Affected infants and children tend to grow quickly; they are significantly taller than their siblings and peers and have an unusually large head. However, adult height is usually in the normal range.People with Sotos syndrome often have intellectual disability, and most also have behavioral problems. Frequent behavioral issues include attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), phobias, obsessions and compulsions, tantrums, and impulsive behaviors. Problems with speech and language are also common. Affected individuals often have a stutter, a monotone voice, and problems with sound production. Additionally, weak muscle tone (hypotonia) may delay other aspects of early development, particularly motor skills such as sitting and crawling.Other signs and symptoms of Sotos syndrome can include an abnormal side-to-side curvature of the spine (scoliosis), seizures, heart or kidney defects, hearing loss, and problems with vision. Some infants with this disorder experience yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice) and poor feeding.A small percentage of people with Sotos syndrome have developed cancer, most often in childhood, but no single form of cancer occurs most frequently with this condition. It remains uncertain whether Sotos syndrome increases the risk of specific types of cancer. If people with this disorder have an increased cancer risk, it is only slightly greater than that of the general population.","medgen_id":"C0175695","alternate_names":["Sotos' syndrome"],"name":"Sotos syndrome","id":"36672","alternate_symbols":["SOTOS1"],"type":"Disease","xrefs":["{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"PS117550\",\"type\":\"Phenotypic series\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"821\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Alliance\",\"id\":\"Sotos+syndrome/6665\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"Sotos' syndrome\"}","{\"db\":\"SNOMED CT\",\"id\":\"75968004\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"Sotos' syndrome\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000525320\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_symbols\",\"ref_field_element\":\"SOTOS1\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"sotos-syndrome\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"PS117550\",\"type\":\"Phenotypic series\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Office of Rare Diseases\",\"id\":\"10091\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"sotos-syndrome\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}"]}

The additional parts of the urinary tract that may be affected include the bladder, the tubes that carry urine from each kidney to the bladder (the ureters), and the tube that carries urine from the bladder out of the body (the urethra). CAKUT results from abnormal development of the urinary system and is present from birth (congenital), although the abnormality may not become apparent until later in life.Individuals with CAKUT have one or more kidney or urinary tract abnormalities. For paired structures, like the kidneys and ureters, one or both may be affected. Many different developmental abnormalities are classified as CAKUT, including underdevelopment or absence of a kidney (renal hypodysplasia or agenesis), a kidney formed of fluid-filled sacs called cysts (multicystic dysplastic kidney), buildup of urine in the kidneys (hydronephrosis), an extra ureter leading to the kidney (duplex kidney or duplicated collecting system), a blockage in a ureter where it joins the kidney (ureteropelvic junction obstruction), an abnormally wide ureter (megaureter), backflow of urine from the bladder into the ureter (vesicoureteral reflux), and an abnormal membrane in the urethra that blocks the flow of urine out of the bladder (posterior urethral valve).CAKUT varies in severity. The abnormalities can result in recurrent urinary tract infections or a buildup of urine in the urinary tract, which may damage the kidneys or other structures. Severe CAKUT can result in life-threatening kidney failure and end-stage renal disease.CAKUT is often one of several features of a condition that affects multiple body systems (syndromic CAKUT). For example, renal coloboma syndrome, 17q12 deletion syndrome, renal cysts and diabetes (RCAD) syndrome, Fraser syndrome, Townes-Brocks syndrome, and branchio-oto-renal syndrome can cause kidney or urinary tract abnormalities in addition to other problems. However, urinary system abnormalities sometimes occur without other signs and symptoms, which is known as nonsyndromic or isolated CAKUT.","medgen_id":"C1968949","alternate_names":[],"name":"Congenital anomalies of kidney and urinary tract","id":"34805","alternate_symbols":[],"type":"Disease","xrefs":["{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"PS610805\",\"type\":\"Phenotypic series\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"93545\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"PS610805\",\"type\":\"Phenotypic series\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"congenital-anomalies-of-kidney-and-urinary-tract\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}"]}
{"attribute_content":[],"keywords":[],"public_definition":"Heterotaxy syndrome is a condition in which the internal organs are abnormally arranged in the chest and abdomen. The term \"heterotaxy\" is from the Greek words \"heteros,\" meaning \"other than,\" and \"taxis,\" meaning \"arrangement.\" Individuals with this condition have complex birth defects affecting the heart, lungs, liver, spleen, intestines, and other organs.In the normal body, most of the organs in the chest and abdomen have a particular location on the right or left side. For example, the heart, spleen, and pancreas are on the left side of the body, and most of the liver is on the right. This normal arrangement of the organs is known as \"situs solitus.\" Rarely, the orientation of the internal organs is completely flipped from right to left, a situation known as \"situs inversus.\" This mirror-image orientation usually does not cause any health problems, unless it occurs as part of a syndrome affecting other parts of the body. Heterotaxy syndrome is an arrangement of internal organs somewhere between situs solitus and situs inversus; this condition is also known as \"situs ambiguus.\" Unlike situs inversus, the abnormal arrangement of organs in heterotaxy syndrome often causes serious health problems.Heterotaxy syndrome can alter the structure of the heart, including the attachment of the large blood vessels that carry blood to and from the rest of the body. It can also affect the structure of the lungs, such as the number of lobes in each lung and the length of the tubes (called bronchi) that lead from the windpipe to the lungs. In the abdomen, the condition can cause a person to have no spleen (asplenia) or multiple small, poorly functioning spleens (polysplenia). The liver may lie across the middle of the body instead of being in its normal position to the right of the stomach. Some affected individuals also have intestinal malrotation, which is an abnormal twisting of the intestines that occurs in the early stages of development before birth.Depending on the organs involved, signs and symptoms of heterotaxy syndrome can include a bluish appearance of the skin or lips (cyanosis, which is due to a shortage of oxygen), breathing difficulties, an increased risk of infections, and problems with digesting food. The most serious complications are generally caused by critical congenital heart disease, a group of complex heart defects that are present from birth. Biliary atresia, a problem with the bile ducts in the liver, can also cause severe health problems in infancy.The severity of heterotaxy syndrome varies depending on the specific abnormalities involved. Some affected individuals have only mild health problems related to the condition. At the other end of the spectrum, heterotaxy syndrome can be life-threatening in infancy or childhood, even with treatment.","medgen_id":"C3178805","alternate_names":["Heterotaxy syndrome"],"name":"Heterotaxia","id":"16650","alternate_symbols":[],"type":"Disease","xrefs":["{\"db\":\"Human Phenotype Ontology\",\"id\":\"HP:0030853\",\"type\":\"primary\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"450\"}","{\"db\":\"Human Phenotype Ontology\",\"id\":\"HP:0030853\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"450\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"heterotaxy-syndrome\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}"]}

People with CVID are highly susceptible to infection from foreign invaders such as bacteria, or more rarely, viruses and often develop recurrent infections, particularly in the lungs, sinuses, and ears. Pneumonia is common in people with CVID. Over time, recurrent infections can lead to chronic lung disease. Affected individuals may also experience infection or inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract, which can cause diarrhea and weight loss. Abnormal accumulation of immune cells causes enlarged lymph nodes (lymphadenopathy) or an enlarged spleen (splenomegaly) in some people with CVID. Immune cells can accumulate in other organs, forming small lumps called granulomas.Approximately 25 percent of people with CVID have an autoimmune disorder, which occurs when the immune system malfunctions and attacks the body's tissues and organs. The blood cells are most frequently affected by autoimmune attacks in CVID; the most commonly occurring autoimmune disorders are immune thrombocytopenia, which is an abnormal bleeding disorder caused by a decrease in cells involved in blood clotting called platelets, and autoimmune hemolytic anemia, which results in premature destruction of red blood cells. Other autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis can occur. Individuals with CVID also have a greater than normal risk of developing certain types of cancer, including a cancer of immune system cells called non-Hodgkin lymphoma and less frequently, stomach (gastric) cancer.People with CVID may start experiencing signs and symptoms of the disorder anytime between childhood and adulthood; most people with CVID are diagnosed in their twenties or thirties. The life expectancy of individuals with CVID varies depending on the severity and frequency of illnesses they experience. Most people with CVID live into adulthood.There are many different types of CVID that are distinguished by genetic cause.

Although this condition can appear at any age, it most often begins in adolescence.Narcolepsy is characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness. Affected individuals feel tired during the day, and several times a day they may experience an overwhelming urge to sleep. \"Sleep attacks\" can occur at unusual times, such as during a meal or in the middle of a conversation. They last from a few seconds to a few minutes and often lead to a longer nap, after which affected individuals wake up feeling refreshed.Another common feature of narcolepsy is cataplexy, which is a sudden loss of muscle tone in response to strong emotion (such as laughing, surprise, or anger). These episodes of muscle weakness can cause an affected person to slump over or fall, which occasionally leads to injury. Episodes of cataplexy usually last just a few seconds, and they may occur from several times a day to a few times a year. Most people diagnosed with narcolepsy also have cataplexy. However, some do not, which has led researchers to distinguish two major forms of the condition: narcolepsy with cataplexy and narcolepsy without cataplexy.Narcolepsy also affects nighttime sleep. Most affected individuals have trouble sleeping for more than a few hours at night. They often experience vivid hallucinations while falling asleep (hypnogogic hallucinations) or while waking up (hypnopompic hallucinations). Affected individuals often have realistic and distressing dreams, and they may act out their dreams by moving excessively or talking in their sleep. Many people with narcolepsy also experience sleep paralysis, which is an inability to move or speak for a short period while falling asleep or awakening. The combination of hallucinations, vivid dreams, and sleep paralysis is often frightening and unpleasant for affected individuals.Some people with narcolepsy have all of the major features of the disorder, while others have only one or two.

{"attribute_content":[],"keywords":[],"public_definition":"Mandibuloacral dysplasia is a condition that causes a variety of abnormalities involving bone development, skin coloring (pigmentation), and fat distribution. People with this condition may grow slowly after birth. Most affected individuals are born with an underdeveloped lower jaw bone (mandible) and small collar bones (clavicles), leading to the characteristic features of a small chin and sloped shoulders. Other bone problems include loss of bone from the tips of the fingers (acroosteolysis), which causes bulbous finger tips; delayed closure of certain skull bones; and joint deformities (contractures).People with mandibuloacral dysplasia can have mottled or patchy skin pigmentation or other skin abnormalities. Some people with this condition have features of premature aging (a condition called progeria), such as thin skin, loss of teeth, loss of hair, and a beaked nose. Some individuals with mandibuloacral dysplasia have metabolic problems, such as diabetes.A common feature of mandibuloacral dysplasia is a lack of fatty tissue under the skin (lipodystrophy) in certain regions of the body. The two types of this disorder, mandibuloacral dysplasia with type A lipodystrophy (MADA) and mandibuloacral dysplasia with type B lipodystrophy (MADB) are distinguished by the pattern of fat distribution throughout the body. Type A is described as partial lipodystrophy; affected individuals have a loss of fatty tissue from the torso and limbs, but it may build up around the neck and shoulders. Type B is a generalized lipodystrophy, with loss of fatty tissue in the face, torso, and limbs.MADA usually begins in adulthood, although children can be affected. MADB begins earlier, often just after birth. Many babies with MADB are born prematurely.","medgen_id":"C0432291","alternate_names":["Mandibuloacral dysostosis"],"name":"Mandibuloacral dysplasia","id":"16643","alternate_symbols":[],"type":"Disease","xrefs":["{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"PS248370\",\"type\":\"Phenotypic series\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"2457\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Alliance\",\"id\":\"Mandibuloacral+dysostosis/8786\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"Mandibuloacral dysostosis\"}","{\"db\":\"SNOMED CT\",\"id\":\"109419009\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"Mandibuloacral dysostosis\"}","{\"db\":\"CSER _CC_NCGL, University of Washington\",\"id\":\"UWMG_2593822\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"mandibuloacral-dysplasia\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}"]}

{"attribute_content":[],"keywords":[],"public_definition":"Primary coenzyme Q10 deficiency is a disorder that can affect many parts of the body, especially the brain, muscles, and kidneys. As its name suggests, the disorder involves a shortage (deficiency) of a substance called coenzyme Q10.The severity, combination of signs and symptoms, and age of onset of primary coenzyme Q10 deficiency vary widely. In the most severe cases, the condition becomes apparent in infancy and causes severe brain dysfunction combined with muscle weakness (encephalomyopathy) and the failure of other body systems. These problems can be life-threatening. The mildest cases of primary coenzyme Q10 deficiency can begin as late as a person's sixties and often cause cerebellar ataxia, which refers to problems with coordination and balance due to defects in the part of the brain that is involved in coordinating movement (cerebellum). Other neurological abnormalities that can occur in primary coenzyme Q10 deficiency include seizures, intellectual disability, poor muscle tone (hypotonia), involuntary muscle contractions (dystonia), progressive muscle stiffness (spasticity), abnormal eye movements (nystagmus), vision loss caused by degeneration (atrophy) of the optic nerves or breakdown of the light-sensing tissue at the back of the eyes (retinopathy), and sensorineural hearing loss (which is caused by abnormalities in the inner ear). The neurological problems gradually get worse unless treated with coenzyme Q10 supplementation.A type of kidney dysfunction called nephrotic syndrome is another common feature of primary coenzyme Q10 deficiency. It can occur with or without neurological abnormalities. Nephrotic syndrome occurs when damage to the kidneys impairs their function, which allows protein from the blood to pass into the urine (proteinuria). Other signs and symptoms of nephrotic syndrome include increased cholesterol in the blood (hypercholesterolemia), an abnormal buildup of fluid in the abdominal cavity (ascites), and swelling (edema). Affected individuals may also have blood in the urine (hematuria), which can lead to a reduced number of red blood cells in the body (anemia), abnormal blood clotting, or reduced amounts of certain white blood cells. Low white blood cell counts can lead to a weakened immune system and frequent infections in people with nephrotic syndrome. If not treated with coenzyme Q10 supplementation, affected individuals eventually develop irreversible kidney failure (end-stage renal disease).A type of heart disease that enlarges and weakens the heart muscle (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy) can also occur in primary coenzyme Q10 deficiency.","medgen_id":"CN229570","alternate_names":["Coenzyme Q10 deficiency"],"name":"Coenzyme Q10 deficiency, primary","id":"33110","alternate_symbols":[],"type":"Disease","xrefs":["{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"PS607426\",\"type\":\"Phenotypic series\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"35656\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Alliance\",\"id\":\"Coenzyme+Q10+Deficiency/1707\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"Coenzyme Q10 deficiency\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"PS607426\",\"type\":\"Phenotypic series\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"primary-coenzyme-q10-deficiency\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}"]}

Defects in connective tissues cause the signs and symptoms of these conditions, which range from mildly loose joints to life-threatening complications.The various forms of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome have been classified in several different ways. Originally, 11 forms of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome were named using Roman numerals to indicate the types (type I, type II, and so on). In 1997, researchers proposed a simpler classification (the Villefranche nomenclature) that reduced the number of types to six and gave them descriptive names based on their major features. In 2017, the classification was updated to include rare forms of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome that were discovered more recently. The 2017 classification describes 13 types of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.An unusually large range of joint movement (hypermobility) occurs in most forms of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, and it is a hallmark feature of the hypermobile type. Infants and children with hypermobility often have weak muscle tone (hypotonia), which can delay the development of motor skills such as sitting, standing, and walking. The loose joints are unstable and prone to dislocation and chronic pain. In the arthrochalasia type of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, infants have hypermobility and dislocations of both hips at birth.Many people with the Ehlers-Danlos syndromes have soft, velvety skin that is highly stretchy (elastic) and fragile. Affected individuals tend to bruise easily, and some types of the condition also cause abnormal scarring. People with the classical form of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome experience wounds that split open with little bleeding and leave scars that widen over time to create characteristic \"cigarette paper\" scars. The dermatosparaxis type of the disorder is characterized by loose skin that sags and wrinkles, and extra (redundant) folds of skin may be present.Some forms of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, notably the vascular type and to a lesser extent the kyphoscoliotic, classical, and classical-like types, can cause unpredictable tearing (rupture) of blood vessels, leading to internal bleeding and other potentially life-threatening complications. The vascular type of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is also associated with an increased risk of organ rupture, including tearing of the intestine and rupture of the uterus during pregnancy.Other types of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome have additional signs and symptoms. The cardiac-valvular type causes severe problems with the valves that control the movement of blood through the heart. People with the kyphoscoliotic type experience severe curvature of the spine that worsens over time and can interfere with breathing by restricting lung expansion. A type of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome called brittle cornea syndrome is characterized by thinness of the clear covering of the eye (the cornea) and other eye abnormalities. The spondylodysplastic type features short stature and skeletal abnormalities such as abnormally curved (bowed) limbs. Abnormalities of muscles, including hypotonia and permanently bent joints (contractures), are among the characteristic signs of the musculocontractural and myopathic forms of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. The periodontal type causes abnormalities of the teeth and gums.","medgen_id":"C0013720","alternate_names":[],"name":"Ehlers-Danlos syndrome","id":"6501","alternate_symbols":[],"type":"Disease","xrefs":["{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"PS130000\",\"type\":\"Phenotypic series\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"98249\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"ehlers-danlos-syndrome\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"PS130000\",\"type\":\"Phenotypic series\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Office of Rare Diseases\",\"id\":\"6322\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"SNOMED CT\",\"id\":\"398114001\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"ehlers-danlos-syndrome\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}","{\"db\":\"Office of Rare Diseases\",\"id\":\"6322\",\"ref_field\":\"symbol\"}"]}

Because this deletion occurs at the end (terminus) of the long (q) arm of chromosome 11, Jacobsen syndrome is also known as 11q terminal deletion disorder.The signs and symptoms of Jacobsen syndrome vary considerably. Most affected individuals have delayed development, including the development of speech and motor skills (such as sitting, standing, and walking). Most also have cognitive impairment and learning difficulties. Behavioral problems have been reported, including compulsive behavior (such as shredding paper), a short attention span, and easy distractibility. Many people with Jacobsen syndrome have been diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Jacobsen syndrome is also associated with an increased likelihood of autism spectrum disorders, which are characterized by impaired communication and socialization skills.Jacobsen syndrome is also characterized by distinctive facial features. These include small and low-set ears, widely set eyes (hypertelorism) with droopy eyelids (ptosis), skin folds covering the inner corner of the eyes (epicanthal folds), a broad nasal bridge, downturned corners of the mouth, a thin upper lip, and a small lower jaw. Affected individuals often have a large head size (macrocephaly) and a skull abnormality called trigonocephaly, which gives the forehead a pointed appearance.More than 90 percent of people with Jacobsen syndrome have a bleeding disorder called Paris-Trousseau syndrome. This condition causes a lifelong risk of abnormal bleeding and easy bruising. Paris-Trousseau syndrome is a disorder of platelets, which are blood cells that are necessary for blood clotting.Other features of Jacobsen syndrome can include heart defects, feeding difficulties in infancy, short stature, frequent ear and sinus infections, and skeletal abnormalities. The disorder can also affect the digestive system, kidneys, and genitalia. The life expectancy of people with Jacobsen syndrome is unknown, although affected individuals have lived into adulthood.","medgen_id":"C0795841","alternate_names":["Jacobsen Distal 11q Deletion Syndrome"],"name":"11q partial monosomy syndrome","id":"2431","alternate_symbols":[],"type":"Disease","xrefs":["{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"147791\",\"type\":\"MIM\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"2308\"}","{\"db\":\"SNOMED CT\",\"id\":\"4325000\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"jacobsen-syndrome\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"147791\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"symbol\"}","{\"db\":\"Office of Rare Diseases\",\"id\":\"307\",\"ref_field\":\"symbol\"}"]}

{"attribute_content":[],"keywords":[],"public_definition":"Critical congenital heart disease (CCHD) is a term that refers to a group of serious heart defects that are present from birth. These abnormalities result from problems with the formation of one or more parts of the heart during the early stages of embryonic development. CCHD prevents the heart from pumping blood effectively or reduces the amount of oxygen in the blood. As a result, organs and tissues throughout the body do not receive enough oxygen, which can lead to organ damage and life-threatening complications. Individuals with CCHD usually require surgery soon after birth.Although babies with CCHD may appear healthy for the first few hours or days of life, signs and symptoms soon become apparent. These can include an abnormal heart sound during a heartbeat (heart murmur), rapid breathing (tachypnea), low blood pressure (hypotension), low levels of oxygen in the blood (hypoxemia), and a blue or purple tint to the skin caused by a shortage of oxygen (cyanosis). If untreated, CCHD can lead to shock, coma, and death. However, most people with CCHD now survive past infancy due to improvements in early detection, diagnosis, and treatment.Some people with treated CCHD have few related health problems later in life. However, long-term effects of CCHD can include delayed development and reduced stamina during exercise. Adults with these heart defects have an increased risk of abnormal heart rhythms, heart failure, sudden cardiac arrest, stroke, and premature death.Each of the heart defects associated with CCHD affects the flow of blood into, out of, or through the heart. Some of the heart defects involve structures within the heart itself, such as the two lower chambers of the heart (the ventricles) or the valves that control blood flow through the heart. Others affect the structure of the large blood vessels leading into and out of the heart (including the aorta and pulmonary artery). Still others involve a combination of these structural abnormalities.People with CCHD have one or more specific heart defects. The heart defects classified as CCHD include coarctation of the aorta, double-outlet right ventricle, D-transposition of the great arteries, Ebstein anomaly, hypoplastic left heart syndrome, interrupted aortic arch, pulmonary atresia with intact septum, single ventricle, total anomalous pulmonary venous connection, tetralogy of Fallot, tricuspid atresia, and truncus arteriosus.","medgen_id":"C0040761","alternate_names":["Transposition of great vessels","Transposition of the great arteries, dextro-looped"],"name":"Transposition of the great arteries","id":"17177","alternate_symbols":[],"type":"Disease","xrefs":["{\"db\":\"Human Phenotype Ontology\",\"id\":\"HP:0001669\",\"type\":\"primary\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"PS608808\",\"type\":\"Phenotypic series\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"216694\"}","{\"db\":\"Human Phenotype Ontology\",\"id\":\"HP:0001669\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"Transposition of great vessels\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"PS608808 \",\"type\":\"Phenotypic series\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"Transposition of the great arteries, dextro-looped\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"critical-congenital-heart-disease\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}"]}

Sympathetic paragangliomas cause catecholamine excess; parasympathetic paragangliomas are most often nonsecretory. Extra-adrenal parasympathetic paragangliomas are located predominantly in the skull base and neck (referred to as head and neck PGL [HNPGL]) and sometimes in the upper mediastinum; approximately 95% of such tumors are nonsecretory. In contrast, sympathetic extra-adrenal paragangliomas are generally confined to the lower mediastinum, abdomen, and pelvis, and are typically secretory. Pheochromocytomas, which arise from the adrenal medulla, typically lead to catecholamine excess. Symptoms of PGL/PCC result from either mass effects or catecholamine hypersecretion (e.g., sustained or paroxysmal elevations in blood pressure, headache, episodic profuse sweating, forceful palpitations, pallor, and apprehension or anxiety).

TdP is usually self-terminating, thus causing a syncopal event, the most common symptom in individuals with LQTS. Such cardiac events typically occur during exercise and emotional stress, less frequently during sleep, and usually without warning. In some instances, TdP degenerates to ventricular fibrillation and causes aborted cardiac arrest (if the individual is defibrillated) or sudden death. Approximately 50% of untreated individuals with a pathogenic variant in one of the genes associated with LQTS have symptoms, usually one to a few syncopal events. While cardiac events may occur from infancy through middle age, they are most common from the preteen years through the 20s. Some types of LQTS are associated with a phenotype extending beyond cardiac arrhythmia. In addition to the prolonged QT interval, associations include muscle weakness and facial dysmorphism in Andersen-Tawil syndrome (LQTS type 7); hand/foot, facial, and neurodevelopmental features in Timothy syndrome (LQTS type 8); and profound sensorineural hearing loss in Jervell and Lange-Nielson syndrome.","medgen_id":"C2678485","alternate_names":[],"name":"Long QT syndrome 9","id":"2567","alternate_symbols":["LQT2/9, DIGENIC"],"type":"Disease","xrefs":["{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"611818\",\"type\":\"MIM\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"101016\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"768\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"611818\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_symbols\",\"ref_field_element\":\"LQT2/9, DIGENIC\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Alliance\",\"id\":\"Long+QT+syndrome+9/4306\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Office of Rare Diseases\",\"id\":\"10435\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"GeneReviews\",\"id\":\"NBK1129\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"611818\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"symbol\"}","{\"db\":\"Office of Rare Diseases\",\"id\":\"10435\",\"ref_field\":\"symbol\"}"]}

Affected individuals usually have macrocephaly, trichilemmomas, and papillomatous papules, and present by the late 20s. The lifetime risk of developing breast cancer is 85%, with an average age of diagnosis between 38 and 46 years. The lifetime risk for thyroid cancer (usually follicular, rarely papillary, but never medullary thyroid cancer) is approximately 35%. The risk for endometrial cancer may approach 28%.

Heart failure is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality; risk of arrhythmia and sudden death is increased. Neutropenia is most often associated with mouth ulcers, pneumonia, and sepsis. The non-progressive myopathy predominantly affects the proximal muscles, and results in early motor delays. Prepubertal growth delay is followed by a post-pubertal growth spurt with remarkable \"catch-up\" growth.

Attenuated FAP is characterized by multiple colonic polyps (average of 30), more proximally located polyps, and a diagnosis of colon cancer at a later age than in FAP. Certain extracolonic manifestations, such as gastric and duodenal polyps or cancers, are variably present in attenuated FAP; risk management may be substantially different between FAP and attenuated FAP.

Lung cancer may not cause signs or symptoms in its early stages. Some people with lung cancer have chest pain, frequent coughing, blood in the mucus, breathing problems, trouble swallowing or speaking, loss of appetite and weight loss, fatigue, or swelling in the face or neck. Additional symptoms can develop if the cancer spreads (metastasizes) into other tissues. Lung cancer occurs most often in adults in their sixties or seventies. Most people who develop lung cancer have a history of long-term tobacco smoking; however, the condition can occur in people who have never smoked.Lung cancer is generally divided into two types, small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer, based on the size of the affected cells when viewed under a microscope. Non-small cell lung cancer accounts for 85 percent of lung cancer, while small cell lung cancer accounts for the remaining 15 percent.Small cell lung cancer grows quickly and in more than half of cases the cancer has spread beyond the lung by the time the condition is diagnosed. Small cell lung cancer often metastasizes, most commonly to the liver, brain, bones, and adrenal glands (small hormone-producing glands located on top of each kidney). After diagnosis, most people with small cell lung cancer survive for about 1 year; less than seven percent survive 5 years.Non-small cell lung cancer is divided into three main subtypes: adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and large cell lung carcinoma. Adenocarcinoma arises from the cells that line the small air sacs (alveoli) located throughout the lungs. Squamous cell carcinoma arises from squamous cells that line the passages leading from the windpipe (trachea) to the lungs (bronchi). Large cell carcinoma arises from epithelial cells that line the lungs. Large cell carcinoma encompasses non-small cell lung cancers that do not appear to be adenocarcinomas or squamous cell carcinomas. The 5-year survival rate for people with non-small cell lung cancer is usually between 11 and 17 percent; it can be lower or higher depending on the subtype and stage of the cancer.","medgen_id":"C0007131","alternate_names":["Non-small cell lung carcinoma"],"name":"Non-small cell lung cancer","disease_mechanism":"Other","id":"7728","alternate_symbols":[],"type":"Disease","disease_mechanism_id":"283","xrefs":["{\"db\":\"Human Phenotype Ontology\",\"id\":\"HP:0030358\",\"type\":\"primary\"}","{\"db\":\"MeSH\",\"id\":\"D002289\"}","{\"db\":\"Human Phenotype Ontology\",\"id\":\"HP:0030358\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"Non-small cell lung carcinoma\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000569448\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000569877\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000569888\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000569891\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000571363\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Alliance\",\"id\":\"Non-small+cell+lung+cancer/5250\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Human Phenotype Ontology\",\"id\":\"HP:0030358\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Office of Rare Diseases\",\"id\":\"7217\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"SNOMED CT\",\"id\":\"254637007\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"lung-cancer\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}","{\"db\":\"Office of Rare Diseases\",\"id\":\"7217\",\"ref_field\":\"symbol\"}"]}

TdP is usually self-terminating, thus causing a syncopal event, the most common symptom in individuals with LQTS. Such cardiac events typically occur during exercise and emotional stress, less frequently during sleep, and usually without warning. In some instances, TdP degenerates to ventricular fibrillation and causes aborted cardiac arrest (if the individual is defibrillated) or sudden death. Approximately 50% of untreated individuals with a pathogenic variant in one of the genes associated with LQTS have symptoms, usually one to a few syncopal events. While cardiac events may occur from infancy through middle age, they are most common from the preteen years through the 20s. Some types of LQTS are associated with a phenotype extending beyond cardiac arrhythmia. In addition to the prolonged QT interval, associations include muscle weakness and facial dysmorphism in Andersen-Tawil syndrome (LQTS type 7); hand/foot, facial, and neurodevelopmental features in Timothy syndrome (LQTS type 8); and profound sensorineural hearing loss in Jervell and Lange-Nielson syndrome.","medgen_id":"C4551647","alternate_names":[],"name":"Long QT syndrome 1","id":"2703","alternate_symbols":[],"type":"Disease","xrefs":["{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"192500\",\"type\":\"MIM\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"101016\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"768\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Alliance\",\"id\":\"Long+QT+syndrome+1/4297\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Office of Rare Diseases\",\"id\":\"3284\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"GeneReviews\",\"id\":\"NBK1129\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"192500\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"symbol\"}","{\"db\":\"Office of Rare Diseases\",\"id\":\"3284\",\"ref_field\":\"symbol\"}"]}

The first symptom in NPD-A is hepatosplenomegaly, usually noted by age three months; over time the liver and spleen become massive. Psychomotor development progresses no further than the 12-month level, after which neurologic deterioration is relentless. A classic cherry-red spot of the macula of the retina, which may not be present in the first few months, is eventually present in all affected children. Interstitial lung disease caused by storage of sphingomyelin in pulmonary macrophages results in frequent respiratory infections and often respiratory failure. Most children succumb before the third year. NPD type B, later in onset and milder in manifestations than NPD type A, is characterized by hepatosplenomegaly with progressive hypersplenism and stable liver dysfunction, gradual deterioration in pulmonary function, osteopenia, and atherogenic lipid profile. Progressive and/or clinically significant neurologic manifestations occur infrequently.

In those with slowly progressive disease, the CNS is not (or is minimally) affected, although the effect of GAG accumulation on other organ systems may be early progressive to the same degree as in those who have progressive cognitive decline. Survival into the early adult years with normal intelligence is common in the slowly progressing form of the disease. Additional findings in both forms of MPS II include: short stature; macrocephaly with or without communicating hydrocephalus; macroglossia; hoarse voice; conductive and sensorineural hearing loss; hepatosplenomegaly; dysostosis multiplex; spinal stenosis; and carpal tunnel syndrome.","medgen_id":"C0026705","alternate_names":["Hunter Syndrome","IDS deficiency","MPS II","SIDS deficiency","Sulfoiduronate sulfatase deficiency"],"name":"Mucopolysaccharidosis, MPS-II","id":"10834","alternate_symbols":[],"type":"Disease","xrefs":["{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"309900\",\"type\":\"MIM\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"217085\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"217093\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"580\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"309900\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"MPS II\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Alliance\",\"id\":\"Mucopolysaccharidosis+type+II/4913\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"SNOMED CT\",\"id\":\"70737009\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"GeneReviews\",\"id\":\"NBK1274\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"309900\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"symbol\"}"]}

For the heart to beat normally, the heart (cardiac) muscle must contract and relax in a coordinated way. Oxygen-rich blood from the lungs travels first through the upper chambers of the heart (the atria), and then to the lower chambers of the heart (the ventricles).In people with familial restrictive cardiomyopathy, the heart muscle is stiff and cannot fully relax after each contraction. Impaired muscle relaxation causes blood to back up in the atria and lungs, which reduces the amount of blood in the ventricles.Familial restrictive cardiomyopathy can appear anytime from childhood to adulthood. The first signs and symptoms of this condition in children are failure to gain weight and grow at the expected rate (failure to thrive), extreme tiredness (fatigue), and fainting. Children who are severely affected may also have abnormal swelling or puffiness (edema), increased blood pressure, an enlarged liver, an abnormal buildup of fluid in the abdominal cavity (ascites), and lung congestion. Some children with familial restrictive cardiomyopathy do not have any obvious signs or symptoms, but they may die suddenly due to heart failure. Without treatment, the majority of affected children survive only a few years after they are diagnosed.Adults with familial restrictive cardiomyopathy typically first develop shortness of breath, fatigue, and a reduced ability to exercise. Some individuals have an irregular heart beat (arrhythmia) and may also experience a sensation of fluttering or pounding in the chest (palpitations) and dizziness. Abnormal blood clots are commonly seen in adults with this condition. Without treatment, approximately one-third of adults with familial restrictive cardiomyopathy do not survive more than five years after diagnosis.","medgen_id":"C0340429","alternate_names":[],"name":"Familial restrictive cardiomyopathy","id":"16785","alternate_symbols":[],"type":"Disease","xrefs":["{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"PS115210\",\"type\":\"Phenotypic series\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"217635\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"PS115210\",\"type\":\"Phenotypic series\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"SNOMED CT\",\"id\":\"233878008\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"familial-restrictive-cardiomyopathy\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}"]}

Less commonly, initial manifestations in some affected individuals are stroke-like episodes (acute fulminant episodes of reversible CNS dysfunction).","medgen_id":"C0393808","alternate_names":["CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH NEUROPATHY, X-LINKED, 1","Charcot-Marie-Tooth Neuropathy X Type 1"],"name":"X-linked hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy","id":"787","alternate_symbols":["CMT2","CMTX"],"type":"Disease","xrefs":["{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"302800\",\"type\":\"MIM\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"101075\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"302800\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH NEUROPATHY, X-LINKED, 1\"}","{\"db\":\"GeneReviews\",\"id\":\"NBK1374\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"Charcot-Marie-Tooth Neuropathy X Type 1\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"302800\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_symbols\",\"ref_field_element\":\"CMT2\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"302800\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_symbols\",\"ref_field_element\":\"CMTX\"}","{\"db\":\"Office of Rare Diseases\",\"id\":\"1258\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_symbols\",\"ref_field_element\":\"CMTX\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Alliance\",\"id\":\"Charcot-Marie-Tooth+Disease+X-Linked+1/1311\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"SNOMED CT\",\"id\":\"230552007\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"GeneReviews\",\"id\":\"NBK1374\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"302800\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"symbol\"}"]}

The clinical manifestations of HCM range from asymptomatic LVH to progressive heart failure to sudden cardiac death (SCD), and vary from individual to individual even within the same family. Common symptoms include shortness of breath (particularly with exertion), chest pain, palpitations, orthostasis, presyncope, and syncope. Most often the LVH of HCM becomes apparent during adolescence or young adulthood, although it may also develop late in life, in infancy, or in childhood.","medgen_id":"C3495498","alternate_names":["MYH7-Related Familial Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy"],"name":"Familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy 1","id":"1311","alternate_symbols":[],"type":"Disease","xrefs":["{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"192600\",\"type\":\"MIM\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Alliance\",\"id\":\"Familial+hypertrophic+cardiomyopathy+1/8382\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"192600\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"symbol\"}"]}

COL1A1/2-OI has been classified into four types based on clinical presentation and radiographic findings. This classification system can be helpful in providing information about prognosis and management for a given individual.

People with nemaline myopathy have muscle weakness (myopathy) throughout the body, but it is typically most severe in the muscles of the face; neck; trunk; and other muscles close to the center of the body (proximal muscles), such as those of the upper arms and legs. This weakness can worsen over time. Affected individuals may have feeding and swallowing difficulties, foot deformities, abnormal curvature of the spine (scoliosis), and joint deformities (contractures). Most people with nemaline myopathy are able to walk, although some affected children may begin walking later than usual. As the condition progresses, some people may require wheelchair assistance. In severe cases, the muscles used for breathing are affected and life-threatening breathing difficulties can occur.Nemaline myopathy is divided into six types. In order of decreasing severity, the types are: severe congenital, Amish, intermediate congenital, typical congenital, childhood-onset, and adult-onset. The types are distinguished by the age when symptoms first appear and the severity of symptoms; however, there is overlap among the various types. The severe congenital type is the most life-threatening. Most individuals with this type do not survive past early childhood due to respiratory failure. The Amish type solely affects the Old Order Amish population of Pennsylvania and is typically fatal in early childhood. The most common type of nemaline myopathy is the typical congenital type, which is characterized by muscle weakness and feeding problems beginning in infancy. Most of these individuals do not have severe breathing problems and can walk unassisted. People with the childhood-onset type usually develop muscle weakness in adolescence. The adult-onset type is the mildest of all the various types. People with this type usually develop muscle weakness between ages 20 and 50.","medgen_id":"C0206157","alternate_names":["Myopathies, Nemaline"],"name":"Nemaline myopathy","id":"9537","alternate_symbols":[],"type":"Disease","xrefs":["{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"PS161800\",\"type\":\"Phenotypic series\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"607\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"PS161800\",\"type\":\"Phenotypic series\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"SNOMED CT\",\"id\":\"75072002\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"nemaline-myopathy\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}"]}

Affected infants frequently present in the first two months of life with symptoms of impaired intestinal motility such as failure to pass meconium within the first 48 hours of life, constipation, emesis, abdominal pain or distention, and occasionally diarrhea. However, because the initial diagnosis of HSCR may be delayed until late childhood or adulthood, HSCR should be considered in anyone with lifelong severe constipation. Individuals with HSCR are at risk for enterocolitis and/or potentially lethal intestinal perforation.","medgen_id":"C3888239","alternate_names":["HIRSCHSPRUNG DISEASE, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, 1","RET-Related Hirschsprung Disease"],"name":"Hirschsprung disease 1","id":"1649","alternate_symbols":["HD","MGC","RET"],"type":"Disease","xrefs":["{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"142623\",\"type\":\"MIM\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"388\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"142623\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"HIRSCHSPRUNG DISEASE, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, 1\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"164761.0014\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"HIRSCHSPRUNG DISEASE, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, 1\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"164761.0015\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"HIRSCHSPRUNG DISEASE, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, 1\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"164761.0016\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"HIRSCHSPRUNG DISEASE, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, 1\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"164761.0017\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"HIRSCHSPRUNG DISEASE, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, 1\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"164761.0018\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"HIRSCHSPRUNG DISEASE, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, 1\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"164761.0019\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"HIRSCHSPRUNG DISEASE, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, 1\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"164761.0020\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"HIRSCHSPRUNG DISEASE, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, 1\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"164761.0021\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"HIRSCHSPRUNG DISEASE, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, 1\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"164761.0022\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"HIRSCHSPRUNG DISEASE, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, 1\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"164761.0023\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"HIRSCHSPRUNG DISEASE, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, 1\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"164761.0028\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"HIRSCHSPRUNG DISEASE, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, 1\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"164761.0035\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"HIRSCHSPRUNG DISEASE, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, 1\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"164761.0036\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"HIRSCHSPRUNG DISEASE, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, 1\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"164761.0037\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"HIRSCHSPRUNG DISEASE, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, 1\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"164761.0038\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"HIRSCHSPRUNG DISEASE, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, 1\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"164761.0050\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"HIRSCHSPRUNG DISEASE, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, 1\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"142623\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_symbols\",\"ref_field_element\":\"MGC\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Alliance\",\"id\":\"Hirschsprung%27s+disease/3429\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Office of Rare Diseases\",\"id\":\"6660\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"GeneReviews\",\"id\":\"NBK1439\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"142623\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"symbol\"}"]}

When a sufficient number of vessels are occluded, the resistance to blood flow through the lungs increases, and the right ventricle attempts to compensate by generating higher pressure to maintain pulmonary blood flow. When the right ventricle can no longer compensate for the increased resistance, progressive heart failure ensues. Initial symptoms include dyspnea (60%), fatigue (19%), syncope (8%), chest pain (7%), palpitations (5%), and leg edema (3%). All ages are affected, but the mean age at diagnosis is 36 years. Mean survival after diagnosis is 2.8 years; current therapy does improve clinical function but has modest effect on survival. The term \"heritable PAH\" (HPAH) includes familial PAH (PAH that occurs in two or more family members) and simplex PAH (i.e., a single occurrence in a family) when a pathogenic variant has been identified. Most heritable PAH (75%) is caused by a pathogenic variant in BMPR2; pathogenic variants in other genes (i.e., ACVRL1, KCNK3, CAV1, SMAD9, BMPR1B) are considerably less common (1%-3%). HPAH has identical symptoms, signs, and histology as PAH of unknown cause. The time from onset of symptoms to diagnosis may be shorter in individuals with familial PAH, possibly because of familial awareness of the disease. Three retrospective studies suggest that persons with PAH who have a BMPR2 pathogenic variant exhibit more severe disease.","medgen_id":"C4552070","alternate_names":["PULMONARY HYPERTENSION, PRIMARY, 1"],"name":"Primary pulmonary hypertension","id":"3581","alternate_symbols":["PAH","PHT"],"type":"Disease","xrefs":["{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"178600\",\"type\":\"MIM\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"422\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"178600\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"PULMONARY HYPERTENSION, PRIMARY, 1\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"600799.0001\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"PULMONARY HYPERTENSION, PRIMARY, 1\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"600799.0002\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"PULMONARY HYPERTENSION, PRIMARY, 1\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"600799.0003\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"PULMONARY HYPERTENSION, PRIMARY, 1\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"600799.0004\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"PULMONARY HYPERTENSION, PRIMARY, 1\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"600799.0005\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"PULMONARY HYPERTENSION, PRIMARY, 1\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"600799.0006\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"PULMONARY HYPERTENSION, PRIMARY, 1\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"600799.0007\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"PULMONARY HYPERTENSION, PRIMARY, 1\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"600799.0008\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"PULMONARY HYPERTENSION, PRIMARY, 1\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"600799.0009\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"PULMONARY HYPERTENSION, PRIMARY, 1\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"600799.0011\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"PULMONARY HYPERTENSION, PRIMARY, 1\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"600799.0012\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"PULMONARY HYPERTENSION, PRIMARY, 1\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"600799.0013\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"PULMONARY HYPERTENSION, PRIMARY, 1\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"600799.0014\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"PULMONARY HYPERTENSION, PRIMARY, 1\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"600799.0015\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"PULMONARY HYPERTENSION, PRIMARY, 1\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"600799.0016\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"PULMONARY HYPERTENSION, PRIMARY, 1\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"600799.0017\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"PULMONARY HYPERTENSION, PRIMARY, 1\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"600799.0018\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"PULMONARY HYPERTENSION, PRIMARY, 1\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"600799.0019\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"PULMONARY HYPERTENSION, PRIMARY, 1\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"600799.0021\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"PULMONARY HYPERTENSION, PRIMARY, 1\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"600799.0023\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"PULMONARY HYPERTENSION, PRIMARY, 1\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"600799.0024\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"PULMONARY HYPERTENSION, PRIMARY, 1\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"600799.0025\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"PULMONARY HYPERTENSION, PRIMARY, 1\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"178600\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_symbols\",\"ref_field_element\":\"PAH\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"178600\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_symbols\",\"ref_field_element\":\"PHT\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Alliance\",\"id\":\"Idiopathic+pulmonary+hypertension/3758\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"SNOMED CT\",\"id\":\"26174007\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"GeneReviews\",\"id\":\"NBK1485\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"178600\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"symbol\"}"]}

This cancer typically occurs in areas that are only occasionally sun-exposed; tumors are most commonly found on the back in men and on the legs in women. Melanoma usually occurs on the skin (cutaneous melanoma), but in about 5 percent of cases it develops in melanocytes in other tissues, including the eyes (uveal melanoma) or mucous membranes that line the body's cavities, such as the moist lining of the mouth (mucosal melanoma). Melanoma can develop at any age, but it most frequently occurs in people in their fifties to seventies and is becoming more common in teenagers and young adults.Melanoma may develop from an existing mole or other normal skin growth that becomes cancerous (malignant); however, many melanomas are new growths. Melanomas often have ragged edges and an irregular shape. They can range from a few millimeters to several centimeters across. They can also be a variety of colors: brown, black, red, pink, blue, or white.Most melanomas affect only the outermost layer of skin (the epidermis). If a melanoma becomes thicker and involves multiple layers of skin, it can spread to other parts of the body (metastasize).A large number of moles or other pigmented skin growths on the body, generally more than 25, is associated with an increased risk of developing melanoma. Melanoma is also a common feature of genetic syndromes affecting the skin such as xeroderma pigmentosum. Additionally, individuals who have previously had melanoma are nearly nine times more likely than the general population to develop melanoma again. It is estimated that about 90 percent of individuals with melanoma survive at least 5 years after being diagnosed.","medgen_id":"C0025202","alternate_names":["Malignant melanoma, somatic"],"name":"Cutaneous melanoma","id":"18337","alternate_symbols":[],"type":"Disease","xrefs":["{\"db\":\"Human Phenotype Ontology\",\"id\":\"HP:0012056\",\"type\":\"primary\"}","{\"db\":\"MeSH\",\"id\":\"D008545\"}","{\"db\":\"Human Phenotype Ontology\",\"id\":\"HP:0012056\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"melanoma\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}"]}

These include: Hypomyelination, hypodontia, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (4H syndrome); Ataxia, delayed dentition, and hypomyelination (ADDH); Tremor-ataxia with central hypomyelination (TACH); Leukodystrophy with oligodontia (LO); Hypomyelination with cerebellar atrophy and hypoplasia of the corpus callosum (HCAHC). Age of onset is typically in early childhood but later-onset cases have also been reported. An infant with Wiedemann-Rautenstrauch syndrome (neonatal progeroid syndrome) was recently reported to have pathogenic variants in POLR3A on exome sequencing. Confirmation of this as a very severe form of POLR3-related leukodystrophy awaits replication in other individuals with a clinical diagnosis of Wiedemann-Rautenstrauch syndrome.","medgen_id":"C2676243","alternate_names":["ATAXIA, DELAYED DENTITION, AND HYPOMYELINATION","LEUKODYSTROPHY, HYPOMYELINATING, 7, WITH OLIGODONTIA","LEUKODYSTROPHY, HYPOMYELINATING, 7, WITH OLIGODONTIA AND HYPOGONADOTROPIC HYPOGONADISM","LEUKODYSTROPHY, HYPOMYELINATING, 7, WITH OR WITHOUT OLIGODONTIA AND/OR HYPOGONADOTROPIC HYPOGONADISM","LEUKODYSTROPHY, HYPOMYELINATING, 7, WITHOUT OLIGODONTIA OR HYPOGONADOTROPIC HYPOGONADISM","LEUKOENCEPHALOPATHY, HYPOMYELINATING, WITH ATAXIA AND DELAYED DENTITION","Leukodystrophy with oligodontia","Leukodystrophy, hypomyelinating, with hypodontia and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism"],"name":"Hypomyelinating leukodystrophy 7","id":"5403","alternate_symbols":["ADDH"],"type":"Disease","xrefs":["{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"607694\",\"type\":\"MIM\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"137639\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"447893\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"447896\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"77295\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"88637\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"607694\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"ATAXIA, DELAYED DENTITION, AND HYPOMYELINATION\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"614258.0002\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"LEUKODYSTROPHY, HYPOMYELINATING, 7, WITH OLIGODONTIA\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"614258.0003\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"LEUKODYSTROPHY, HYPOMYELINATING, 7, WITH OLIGODONTIA\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"614258.0005\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"LEUKODYSTROPHY, HYPOMYELINATING, 7, WITH OLIGODONTIA\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"614258.0003\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"LEUKODYSTROPHY, HYPOMYELINATING, 7, WITH OLIGODONTIA AND HYPOGONADOTROPIC HYPOGONADISM\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"614258.0004\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"LEUKODYSTROPHY, HYPOMYELINATING, 7, WITH OLIGODONTIA AND HYPOGONADOTROPIC HYPOGONADISM\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"607694\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"LEUKODYSTROPHY, HYPOMYELINATING, 7, WITH OR WITHOUT OLIGODONTIA AND/OR HYPOGONADOTROPIC HYPOGONADISM\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"614258.0001\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"LEUKODYSTROPHY, HYPOMYELINATING, 7, WITH OR WITHOUT OLIGODONTIA AND/OR HYPOGONADOTROPIC HYPOGONADISM\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"614258.0006\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"LEUKODYSTROPHY, HYPOMYELINATING, 7, WITHOUT OLIGODONTIA OR HYPOGONADOTROPIC HYPOGONADISM\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"614258.0007\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"LEUKODYSTROPHY, HYPOMYELINATING, 7, WITHOUT OLIGODONTIA OR HYPOGONADOTROPIC HYPOGONADISM\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"607694\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"LEUKOENCEPHALOPATHY, HYPOMYELINATING, WITH ATAXIA AND DELAYED DENTITION\"}","{\"db\":\"Office of Rare Diseases\",\"id\":\"9632\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"Leukodystrophy with oligodontia\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"607694\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_symbols\",\"ref_field_element\":\"ADDH\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Alliance\",\"id\":\"Leukodystrophy+with+oligodontia/4200\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"GeneReviews\",\"id\":\"NBK99167\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"607694\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"symbol\"}"]}

Infantile NPH can present in utero with oligohydramnios sequence (limb contractures, pulmonary hypoplasia, and facial dysmorphisms) or postnatally with renal manifestations that progress to ESRD before age 3 years. Juvenile NPH, the most prevalent subtype, typically presents with polydipsia and polyuria, growth retardation, chronic iron-resistant anemia, or other findings related to chronic kidney disease (CKD). Hypertension is typically absent due to salt wasting. ESRD develops at a median age of 13 years. Ultrasound findings are increased echogenicity, reduced corticomedullary differentiation, and renal cysts (in 50% of affected individuals). Histologic findings include tubulointerstitial fibrosis, thickened and disrupted tubular basement membrane, sporadic corticomedullary cysts, and normal or reduced kidney size. Adolescent/adult NPH is clinically similar to juvenile NPH, but ESRD develops at a median age of 19 years. Within a subtype, inter- and intrafamilial variability in rate of progression to ESRD is considerable. Approximately 80%-90% of individuals with the NPH phenotype have no extrarenal features (i.e., they have isolated NPH); ~10%-20% have extrarenal manifestations that constitute a recognizable syndrome (e.g., Joubert syndrome, Bardet-Biedl syndrome, Jeune syndrome and related skeletal disorders, Meckel-Gruber syndrome, Senior-Løken syndrome, Leber congenital amaurosis, COACH syndrome, and oculomotor apraxia, Cogan type).","medgen_id":"C0687120","alternate_names":["juvenile nephronophthisis"],"name":"Nephronophthisis","id":"16739","alternate_symbols":[],"type":"Disease","xrefs":["{\"db\":\"Human Phenotype Ontology\",\"id\":\"HP:0000090\",\"type\":\"primary\"}","{\"db\":\"Human Phenotype Ontology\",\"id\":\"HP:0004748\",\"type\":\"secondary\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"PS256100\",\"type\":\"Phenotypic series\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"655\"}","{\"db\":\"Human Phenotype Ontology\",\"id\":\"HP:0000090\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"juvenile nephronophthisis\"}","{\"db\":\"GeneTests\",\"id\":\"72016\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Human Phenotype Ontology\",\"id\":\"HP:0000090\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"PS256100\",\"type\":\"Phenotypic series\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"SNOMED CT\",\"id\":\"204958008\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"GeneReviews\",\"id\":\"NBK368475\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}"]}

These difficulties can interfere with affected individuals' ability to function in social, academic, and employment settings. People with ASD also have an increased risk of psychiatric problems such as anxiety, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and eating disorders.From as early as 1 to 2 years of age, people with ASD have an impaired ability to interact with other people; they are often more comfortable dealing with objects. Affected individuals have difficulty understanding and using non-verbal social cues such as eye contact, facial expressions, gestures, and body language. Inability to recognize and use these cues makes it hard for affected individuals to understand the feelings of others or communicate their own feelings appropriately. Behavioral signs of ASD, such as reduced eye contact and social interaction, can sometimes be detected before age 2. However, the condition is usually diagnosed between ages 2 and 4, when more advanced communication and social skills, such as learning to play with others, typically begin to develop.Repetitive behaviors in ASD can include simple actions such as rocking, hand-flapping, or repetition of words or noises (echolalia). Affected individuals often dwell on or repeatedly express particular thoughts; this behavior is called perseveration. People with ASD tend to be rigid about their established routines and may strongly resist disruptions such as changes in schedule. They may also have difficulty tolerating sensory stimuli such as loud noises or bright lights.While social and communication difficulties and unusual behaviors define ASD, affected individuals can have a wide range of intellectual abilities and language skills. A majority of people with ASD have mild to moderate intellectual disability, while others have average to above-average intelligence. Some have particular cognitive abilities that greatly surpass their overall level of functioning, often in areas such as music, mathematics, or memory.Some people with ASD do not speak at all, while others use language fluently. However, fluent speakers with ASD often have problems associated with verbal communication. They might speak in a monotone voice, have unusual vocal mannerisms, or choose unusual topics of conversation.Several diagnoses that used to be classified as separate conditions are now grouped together under the diagnosis of ASD. For example, autistic disorder was a term that was used when affected individuals had limited or absent verbal communication, often in combination with intellectual disability. By contrast, Asperger syndrome was a diagnosis formerly applied to affected individuals of average or above-average intelligence who were not delayed in their language development. The broader diagnosis of ASD was established because many affected individuals fall outside of the strict definitions of the narrower diagnoses, and their intellectual and communication abilities may change over time. However, some individuals who were previously diagnosed with one of the subtypes now do not meet all the criteria of the new umbrella diagnosis.","medgen_id":"C1510586","alternate_names":["Autism spectrum disorders","Autism susceptibility"],"name":"Autism spectrum disorder","id":"9460","alternate_symbols":[],"type":"Disease","xrefs":["{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"PS209850\",\"type\":\"Phenotypic series\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"106\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Alliance\",\"id\":\"Autism+Spectrum+Disorders/7767\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"Autism spectrum disorders\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"autism-spectrum-disorder\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}"]}

In contrast, syndromic hearing loss occurs with signs and symptoms affecting other parts of the body.Nonsyndromic hearing loss can be classified in several different ways. One common way is by the condition's pattern of inheritance: autosomal dominant (DFNA), autosomal recessive (DFNB), X-linked (DFNX), or mitochondrial (which does not have a special designation). Each of these types of hearing loss includes multiple subtypes. DFNA, DFNB, and DFNX subtypes are numbered in the order in which they were first described. For example, DFNA1 was the first type of autosomal dominant nonsyndromic hearing loss to be identified.The characteristics of nonsyndromic hearing loss vary among the different types. Hearing loss can affect one ear (unilateral) or both ears (bilateral). Degrees of hearing loss range from mild (difficulty understanding soft speech) to profound (inability to hear even very loud noises). The term \"deafness\" is often used to describe severe-to-profound hearing loss. Hearing loss can be stable, or it may be progressive, becoming more severe as a person gets older. Particular types of nonsyndromic hearing loss show distinctive patterns of hearing loss. For example, the loss may be more pronounced at high, middle, or low tones.Most forms of nonsyndromic hearing loss are described as sensorineural, which means they are associated with a permanent loss of hearing caused by damage to structures in the inner ear. The inner ear processes sound and sends the information to the brain in the form of electrical nerve impulses. Less commonly, nonsyndromic hearing loss is described as conductive, meaning it results from changes in the middle ear. The middle ear contains three tiny bones that help transfer sound from the eardrum to the inner ear. Some forms of nonsyndromic hearing loss, particularly a type called DFNX2, involve changes in both the inner ear and the middle ear. This combination is called mixed hearing loss.Depending on the type, nonsyndromic hearing loss can become apparent at any time from infancy to old age. Hearing loss that is present before a child learns to speak is classified as prelingual or congenital. Hearing loss that occurs after the development of speech is classified as postlingual.","medgen_id":"CN043651","alternate_names":[],"name":"Deafness, X-linked","id":"9547","alternate_symbols":[],"type":"Disease","xrefs":["{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"PS304500\",\"type\":\"Phenotypic series\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Alliance\",\"id\":\"Deafness%2C+X-Linked%2C+DFN/2162\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"PS304500\",\"type\":\"Phenotypic series\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Office of Rare Diseases\",\"id\":\"1715\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"nonsyndromic-hearing-loss\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}"]}

This condition is characterized by progressive difficulty with movement, typically beginning in childhood. Movement abnormalities include involuntary muscle spasms, rigidity, and trouble with walking that worsens over time. Many people with this condition also develop problems with speech (dysarthria), and some develop vision loss. Additionally, affected individuals may experience a loss of intellectual function (dementia) and psychiatric symptoms such as behavioral problems, personality changes, and depression.Pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration is characterized by an abnormal buildup of iron in certain areas of the brain. A particular change called the eye-of-the-tiger sign, which indicates an accumulation of iron, is typically seen on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of the brain in people with this disorder.Researchers have described classic and atypical forms of pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration. The classic form usually appears in early childhood, causing severe problems with movement that worsen rapidly. Features of the atypical form appear later in childhood or adolescence and progress more slowly. Signs and symptoms vary, but the atypical form is more likely than the classic form to involve speech defects and psychiatric problems.A condition called HARP (hypoprebetalipoproteinemia, acanthocytosis, retinitis pigmentosa, and pallidal degeneration), which was historically described as a separate syndrome, is now considered part of pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration. Although HARP is much rarer than classic pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration, both conditions involve problems with movement, dementia, and vision abnormalities.","medgen_id":"CN043643","alternate_names":[],"name":"Neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation","id":"9539","alternate_symbols":["NBIA"],"type":"Disease","xrefs":["{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"PS234200\",\"type\":\"Phenotypic series\"}","{\"db\":\"Office of Rare Diseases\",\"id\":\"6564\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_symbols\",\"ref_field_element\":\"NBIA\"}","{\"db\":\"GeneTests\",\"id\":\"156905\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"PS234200\",\"type\":\"Phenotypic series\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Office of Rare Diseases\",\"id\":\"6564\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"pantothenate-kinase-associated-neurodegeneration\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}"]}

These nerve cells are found in the spinal cord and the brain. In ALS, motor neurons die (atrophy) over time, leading to muscle weakness, a loss of muscle mass, and an inability to control movement.There are many different types of ALS; these types are distinguished by their signs and symptoms and their genetic cause or lack of clear genetic association. Most people with ALS have a form of the condition that is described as sporadic, which means it occurs in people with no apparent history of the disorder in their family. People with sporadic ALS usually first develop features of the condition in their late fifties or early sixties. A small proportion of people with ALS, estimated at 5 to 10 percent, have a family history of ALS or a related condition called frontotemporal dementia (FTD), which is a progressive brain disorder that affects personality, behavior, and language. The signs and symptoms of familial ALS typically first appear in one's late forties or early fifties. Rarely, people with familial ALS develop symptoms in childhood or their teenage years. These individuals have a rare form of the disorder known as juvenile ALS.The first signs and symptoms of ALS may be so subtle that they are overlooked. The earliest symptoms include muscle twitching, cramping, stiffness, or weakness. Affected individuals may develop slurred speech (dysarthria) and, later, difficulty chewing or swallowing (dysphagia). Many people with ALS experience malnutrition because of reduced food intake due to dysphagia and an increase in their body's energy demands (metabolism) due to prolonged illness. Muscles become weaker as the disease progresses, and arms and legs begin to look thinner as muscle tissue atrophies. Individuals with ALS eventually lose muscle strength and the ability to walk. Affected individuals eventually become wheelchair-dependent and increasingly require help with personal care and other activities of daily living. Over time, muscle weakness causes affected individuals to lose the use of their hands and arms. Breathing becomes difficult because the muscles of the respiratory system weaken. Most people with ALS die from respiratory failure within 2 to 10 years after the signs and symptoms of ALS first appear; however, disease progression varies widely among affected individuals.Approximately 20 percent of individuals with ALS also develop FTD. Changes in personality and behavior may make it difficult for affected individuals to interact with others in a socially appropriate manner. Communication skills worsen as the disease progresses. It is unclear how the development of ALS and FTD are related. Individuals who develop both conditions are diagnosed as having ALS-FTD.A rare form of ALS that often runs in families is known as ALS-parkinsonism-dementia complex (ALS-PDC). This disorder is characterized by the signs and symptoms of ALS, in addition to a pattern of movement abnormalities known as parkinsonism, and a progressive loss of intellectual function (dementia). Signs of parkinsonism include unusually slow movements (bradykinesia), stiffness, and tremors. Affected members of the same family can have different combinations of signs and symptoms.","medgen_id":"C0002736","alternate_names":["Charcot disease","Lou gehrig's disease"],"name":"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis","id":"9457","alternate_symbols":[],"type":"Disease","xrefs":["{\"db\":\"Human Phenotype Ontology\",\"id\":\"HP:0007354\",\"type\":\"primary\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"PS105400\",\"type\":\"Phenotypic series\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"803\"}","{\"db\":\"Human Phenotype Ontology\",\"id\":\"HP:0007354\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"Lou gehrig's disease\"}","{\"db\":\"Human Phenotype Ontology\",\"id\":\"HP:0007354\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"PS105400\",\"type\":\"Phenotypic series\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Office of Rare Diseases\",\"id\":\"5786\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"SNOMED CT\",\"id\":\"86044005\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}","{\"db\":\"Office of Rare Diseases\",\"id\":\"5786\",\"ref_field\":\"symbol\"}"]}

A broad range of clinical features both within and between families is observed. The age of onset ranges from 35 to 87 years. Behavioral disturbances are the most common early feature, followed by progressive aphasia. Impairment in executive function manifests as loss of judgment and insight. In early stages, PPA often manifests as deficits in naming, word finding, or word comprehension. In late stages, affected individuals often become mute and lose their ability to communicate. Early findings of parkinsonism include rigidity, bradykinesia or akinesia (slowing or absence of movements), limb dystonia, apraxia (loss of ability to carry out learned purposeful movements), and disequilibrium. Late motor findings may include myoclonus, dysarthria, and dysphagia. Most affected individuals eventually lose the ability to walk. Disease duration is three to 12 years.","medgen_id":"C1843792","alternate_names":["FRONTOTEMPORAL DEMENTIA WITH TDP43 INCLUSIONS, GRN-RELATED","FRONTOTEMPORAL LOBAR DEGENERATION WITH TDP43 INCLUSIONS,

Although the absence of paramyotonia (muscle stiffness aggravated by cold and exercise) was originally postulated as a means of distinguishing hyperPP from paramyotonia congenita (PMC), approximately 45% of individuals with hyperPP have paramyotonia. In approximately half of affected individuals, attacks of flaccid muscle weakness begin in the first decade of life, with 25% reporting their first attack at age ten years or older. Initially infrequent, the attacks then increase in frequency and severity over time until approximately age 50 years, after which the frequency of attacks declines considerably. Potassium-rich food or rest after exercise may precipitate an attack. A cold environment and emotional stress provoke or worsen the attacks. A spontaneous attack commonly starts in the morning before breakfast, lasts for 15 minutes to one hour, and then disappears. Cardiac arrhythmia or respiratory insufficiency usually does not occur during attacks. Between attacks, approximately half of individuals with hyperPP have mild myotonia (muscle stiffness) that does not impede voluntary movements. More than 80% of individuals with hyperPP older than 40 years report permanent muscle weakness and about one third develop a chronic progressive myopathy.","medgen_id":"CN074266","alternate_names":["ADYNAMIA EPISODICA HEREDITARIA WITH OR WITHOUT MYOTONIA","GAMSTORP DISEASE"],"name":"Hyperkalemic Periodic Paralysis Type 1","id":"15911","alternate_symbols":[],"type":"Disease","xrefs":["{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"170500\",\"type\":\"MIM\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"682\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"170500\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"ADYNAMIA EPISODICA HEREDITARIA WITH OR WITHOUT MYOTONIA\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"170500\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"GAMSTORP DISEASE\"}","{\"db\":\"GeneTests\",\"id\":\"2133\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Alliance\",\"id\":\"Hyperkalemic+Periodic+Paralysis+Type+1/8591\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"GeneReviews\",\"id\":\"NBK1496\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"170500\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"symbol\"}"]}

The signs and symptoms of this condition are caused by abnormal cilia and flagella. Cilia are microscopic, finger-like projections that stick out from the surface of cells. They are found in the linings of the airway, the reproductive system, and other organs and tissues. Flagella are tail-like structures, similar to cilia, that propel sperm cells forward.In the respiratory tract, cilia move back and forth in a coordinated way to move mucus towards the throat. This movement of mucus helps to eliminate fluid, bacteria, and particles from the lungs. Most babies with primary ciliary dyskinesia experience breathing problems at birth, which suggests that cilia play an important role in clearing fetal fluid from the lungs. Beginning in early childhood, affected individuals develop frequent respiratory tract infections. Without properly functioning cilia in the airway, bacteria remain in the respiratory tract and cause infection. People with primary ciliary dyskinesia also have year-round nasal congestion and a chronic cough. Chronic respiratory tract infections can result in a condition called bronchiectasis, which damages the passages, called bronchi, leading from the windpipe to the lungs and can cause life-threatening breathing problems.Some individuals with primary ciliary dyskinesia have abnormally placed organs within their chest and abdomen. These abnormalities arise early in embryonic development when the differences between the left and right sides of the body are established. About 50 percent of people with primary ciliary dyskinesia have a mirror-image reversal of their internal organs (situs inversus totalis). For example, in these individuals the heart is on the right side of the body instead of on the left. Situs inversus totalis does not cause any apparent health problems. When someone with primary ciliary dyskinesia has situs inversus totalis, they are often said to have Kartagener syndrome.Approximately 12 percent of people with primary ciliary dyskinesia have a condition known as heterotaxy syndrome or situs ambiguus, which is characterized by abnormalities of the heart, liver, intestines, or spleen. These organs may be structurally abnormal or improperly positioned. In addition, affected individuals may lack a spleen (asplenia) or have multiple spleens (polysplenia). Heterotaxy syndrome results from problems establishing the left and right sides of the body during embryonic development. The severity of heterotaxy varies widely among affected individuals.Primary ciliary dyskinesia can also lead to infertility. Vigorous movements of the flagella are necessary to propel the sperm cells forward to the female egg cell. Because their sperm do not move properly, males with primary ciliary dyskinesia are usually unable to father children. Infertility occurs in some affected females and is likely due to abnormal cilia in the fallopian tubes.Another feature of primary ciliary dyskinesia is recurrent ear infections (otitis media), especially in young children. Otitis media can lead to permanent hearing loss if untreated. The ear infections are likely related to abnormal cilia within the inner ear.Rarely, individuals with primary ciliary dyskinesia have an accumulation of fluid in the brain (hydrocephalus), likely due to abnormal cilia in the brain.","medgen_id":"C0008780","alternate_names":["Ciliary dyskinesia"],"name":"Primary ciliary dyskinesia","id":"15219","alternate_symbols":["CILD","ICS"],"type":"Disease","xrefs":["{\"db\":\"Human Phenotype Ontology\",\"id\":\"HP:0012265\",\"type\":\"primary\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"PS244400\",\"type\":\"Phenotypic series\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"244\"}","{\"db\":\"Human Phenotype Ontology\",\"id\":\"HP:0012265\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"Ciliary dyskinesia\"}","{\"db\":\"Office of Rare Diseases\",\"id\":\"4484\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_symbols\",\"ref_field_element\":\"ICS\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Alliance\",\"id\":\"Primary+ciliary+dyskinesia/5941\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"PS244400\",\"type\":\"Phenotypic series\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Office of Rare Diseases\",\"id\":\"4484\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"primary-ciliary-dyskinesia\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}"]}

DBA is associated with an increased risk for acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and solid tumors including osteogenic sarcoma.","medgen_id":"C1260899","alternate_names":["ANEMIA, CONGENITAL HYPOPLASTIC, OF BLACKFAN AND DIAMOND","Aase syndrome","Aase-Smith syndrome II","Congenital hypoplastic anemia"],"name":"Diamond-Blackfan anemia","id":"1485","alternate_symbols":["BDS"],"type":"Disease","xrefs":["{\"db\":\"Human Phenotype Ontology\",\"id\":\"HP:0004810\",\"type\":\"primary\"}","{\"db\":\"Human Phenotype Ontology\",\"id\":\"HP:0005545\",\"type\":\"secondary\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"PS105650\",\"type\":\"Phenotypic series\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"124\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"105650\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"ANEMIA, CONGENITAL HYPOPLASTIC, OF BLACKFAN AND DIAMOND\"}","{\"db\":\"Human Phenotype Ontology\",\"id\":\"HP:0004810\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"Congenital hypoplastic anemia\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"105650\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_symbols\",\"ref_field_element\":\"BDS\"}","{\"db\":\"Office of Rare Diseases\",\"id\":\"6274\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_symbols\",\"ref_field_element\":\"BDS\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"diamond-blackfan-anemia\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"PS105650\",\"type\":\"Phenotypic series\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Office of Rare Diseases\",\"id\":\"6274\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"SNOMED CT\",\"id\":\"88854002\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"GeneReviews\",\"id\":\"NBK7047\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"105650\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"symbol\"}","{\"db\":\"Office of Rare Diseases\",\"id\":\"6274\",\"ref_field\":\"symbol\"}"]}

Peripheral nerves connect the brain and spinal cord to muscles and to sensory cells that detect sensations such as touch, pain, heat, and sound. Damage to the peripheral nerves that worsens over time can result in alteration or loss of sensation and wasting (atrophy) of muscles in the feet, legs, and hands.Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease usually becomes apparent in adolescence or early adulthood, but onset may occur anytime from early childhood through late adulthood. Symptoms of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease vary in severity and age of onset even among members of the same family. Some people never realize they have the disorder because their symptoms are so mild, but most have a moderate amount of physical disability. A small percentage of people experience severe weakness or other problems which, in very rare cases, can be life-threatening. In most affected individuals, however, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease does not affect life expectancy.Typically, the earliest symptoms of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease result from muscle atrophy in the feet. Affected individuals may have foot abnormalities such as high arches (pes cavus), flat feet (pes planus), or curled toes (hammer toes). They often have difficulty flexing the foot or walking on the heel of the foot. These difficulties may cause a higher than normal step (steppage gait) and increase the risk of ankle injuries and tripping. As the disease worsens, muscles in the lower legs usually weaken, but leg and foot problems rarely require the use of a wheelchair.Affected individuals may also develop weakness in the hands, causing difficulty with daily activities such as writing, fastening buttons, and turning doorknobs. People with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease typically experience a decreased sensitivity to touch, heat, and cold in the feet and lower legs, but occasionally feel aching or burning sensations. In rare cases, affected individuals have loss of vision or gradual hearing loss that sometimes leads to deafness.There are several types of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, which are differentiated by their effects on nerve cells and patterns of inheritance. Type 1 (CMT1) is characterized by abnormalities in myelin, the fatty substance that covers nerve cells, protecting them and helping to transmit nerve impulses. These abnormalities slow the transmission of nerve impulses and can affect the health of the nerve fiber. Type 2 (CMT2) is characterized by abnormalities in the fiber, or axon, that extends from a nerve cell body to muscles or to sense organs. These abnormalities reduce the strength of the nerve impulse. In forms of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease classified as intermediate type, the nerve impulses are both slowed and reduced in strength, probably due to abnormalities in both myelin and axons. Type 4 (CMT4) is distinguished from the other types by its pattern of inheritance; it can affect either the axons or the myelin. Type X Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMTX) is caused by mutations in genes on the X chromosome, one of the two sex chromosomes. Within the various types of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, subtypes (such as CMT1A, CMT1B, CMT2A, CMT4A, and CMTX1) indicate different genetic causes.Sometimes other, historical names are used to refer to particular forms of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. For example, Roussy-Levy syndrome is a form of CMT11 with the additional feature of rhythmic shaking (tremors). Dejerine-Sottas syndrome is a term sometimes used to describe a severe, early childhood form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease; it is also sometimes called type 3 (CMT3). Depending on the specific gene that is altered, this severe, early-onset form of the disorder may also be classified as CMT1 or CMT4. CMTX5 is also known as Rosenberg-Chutorian syndrome.","medgen_id":"C0007959","alternate_names":["Charcot-Marie-Tooth Neuropathy"],"name":"Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease","id":"13540","alternate_symbols":["CMT","HMSN"],"type":"Disease","xrefs":["{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"PS118220\",\"type\":\"Phenotypic series\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"166\"}","{\"db\":\"Office of Rare Diseases\",\"id\":\"6034\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_symbols\",\"ref_field_element\":\"CMT\"}","{\"db\":\"Office of Rare Diseases\",\"id\":\"6034\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_symbols\",\"ref_field_element\":\"HMSN\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Alliance\",\"id\":\"Charcot-Marie-Tooth+Disease/1276\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"charcot-marie-tooth-disease\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"PS118220\",\"type\":\"Phenotypic series\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Office of Rare Diseases\",\"id\":\"6034\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"SNOMED CT\",\"id\":\"50548001\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"charcot-marie-tooth-disease\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}"]}
