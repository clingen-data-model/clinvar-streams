{"date_created":"2018-10-05","interpretation_comments":["{\"text\":\"This sequence change replaces Isoleucine with Lysine at codon 1307 of the APC protein. The isoleucine residue is mildly conserved among species and is located in a known functional domain of the protein. There is a big physiochemical difference between isoleucine and lysine (Grantham Score 102). This variant is listed in population databases (rs1801155, ExAC 0.3) and is a common finding in individuals of Ashkenazi (~6-10%) and Sephardic Jewish decent (~3%; PMID: 9288102 ,23896379 ).Multiple studies have associated this variant with a moderate increase in the risk of colorectal cancer in individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry, in whom this variant is identified in 28% of cases with familial colorectal cancer (PMID: 9288102 ). In a recent meta-analysis the risk of colorectal cancer development was estimated to be increased 2-fold in Ashkenazi Jewish individuals carrying this variant, while this increase was not evident in other populations (PMID: 23576677).
