The c.3920T\u003eA variant has been reported to result in an adenine replacing a thymine and creating an oligo-adenine (A8) tract that appears to be inherently prone to further somatic mis-pairing and slippage during DNA replication, thereby creating a frameshift change [PMID 9288102, 18770064 and 244162370]. However, this variant has also been reported at a high frequency, present in 6% of Ashkenazi Jews and about 28% of Ashkenazim with a family history of colorectal cancer [PMID: 9288102]. Isoleucine at amino acid position 1307 of the APC protein is weakly conserved during evolution. While not validated for clinical use, the SIFT and PolyPhen-2 algorithms predict this variant to be benign. Ashkenazi Jews who carry the p.Ile1307Lys variant are at increased risk for colorectal neoplasia: the risk for colorectal neoplasia in heterozygous Ashkenazi Jewish individuals was estimated to be between 1.7 to 2.17 compared to non carrier individuals [PMID 12173321, 23576677, 23896379]. This variant is classified as as a risk allele with an increased risk for colorectal neoplasia in the Ashkenazi Jewish population. However the risk in non Jewish populations has not been determined.\"}"],"date_last_updated":"2020-07-30","submitted_assembly":"GRCh37","id":"SCV000839876","interpretation_description":"risk factor","variation_archive_id":"VCV000000822","submitter_id":"500199","version":"1","content":"{\"AttributeSet\":{\"Attribute\":{\"$\":\"ACMG Guidelines, 2015\",\"@Type\":\"AssertionMethod\"},\"Citation\":{\"ID\":{\"$\":\"25741868\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"}}}}","submission_names":["SUB4151980"],"variation_id":"822","date_created":"2018-10-11","clinical_assertion_observation_ids":["SCV000839876.0"],"trait_set_id":"6265","rcv_accession_id":"RCV000020088","submission_id":"500199.2018-06-14","assertion_type":"variation to disease","clinical_assertion_trait_set_id":"SCV000839876"}
