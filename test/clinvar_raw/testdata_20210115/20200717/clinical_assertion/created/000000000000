The aspartic acid residue is highly conserved and there is a moderate physicochemical difference between aspartic acid and glycine. This variant is not present in population databases (ExAC no frequency). This variant has not been reported in the literature in individuals with BRAF-related conditions. ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 13972). This variant has been reported to affect BRAF protein function (PMID: 29595366, 23352452). In summary, the available evidence is currently insufficient to determine the role of this variant in disease. Therefore, it has been classified as a Variant of Uncertain Significance.\"}"],"version":"1","assertion_type":"variation to disease","clinical_assertion_trait_set_id":"SCV001411685","record_status":"current","review_status":"criteria provided, single submitter","submitted_assembly":"GRCh37","variation_archive_id":"VCV000013972","submission_names":["SUB6933842"],"id":"SCV001411685","variation_id":"13972","internal_id":"2746745","interpretation_date_last_evaluated":"2019-09-19","content":"{\"AttributeSet\":{\"Attribute\":{\"$\":\"Invitae Variant Classification Sherloc (09022015)\",\"@Type\":\"AssertionMethod\"},\"Citation\":{\"ID\":{\"$\":\"28492532\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"}}},\"Interpretation\":{\"Citation\":[{\"ID\":{\"$\":\"29595366\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"}},{\"ID\":{\"$\":\"23352452\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"}}]}}","clinical_assertion_observation_ids":["SCV001411685.0"],"rcv_accession_id":"RCV001238853","date_created":"2020-07-13","submission_id":"500031.2020-02-06"}
