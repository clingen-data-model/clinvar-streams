{"keywords":[],"attribute_content":[],"public_definition":"Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is a group of disorders that affect connective tissues supporting the skin, bones, blood vessels, and many other organs and tissues. Defects in connective tissues cause the signs and symptoms of these conditions, which range from mildly loose joints to life-threatening complications.The various forms of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome have been classified in several different ways. Originally, 11 forms of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome were named using Roman numerals to indicate the types (type I, type II, and so on). In 1997, researchers proposed a simpler classification (the Villefranche nomenclature) that reduced the number of types to six and gave them descriptive names based on their major features. In 2017, the classification was updated to include rare forms of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome that were discovered more recently. The 2017 classification describes 13 types of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.An unusually large range of joint movement (hypermobility) occurs in most forms of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, and it is a hallmark feature of the hypermobile type. Infants and children with hypermobility often have weak muscle tone (hypotonia), which can delay the development of motor skills such as sitting, standing, and walking. The loose joints are unstable and prone to dislocation and chronic pain. In the arthrochalasia type of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, infants have hypermobility and dislocations of both hips at birth.Many people with the Ehlers-Danlos syndromes have soft, velvety skin that is highly stretchy (elastic) and fragile. Affected individuals tend to bruise easily, and some types of the condition also cause abnormal scarring. People with the classical form of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome experience wounds that split open with little bleeding and leave scars that widen over time to create characteristic \"cigarette paper\" scars. The dermatosparaxis type of the disorder is characterized by loose skin that sags and wrinkles, and extra (redundant) folds of skin may be present.Some forms of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, notably the vascular type and to a lesser extent the kyphoscoliotic, classical, and classical-like types, can cause unpredictable tearing (rupture) of blood vessels, leading to internal bleeding and other potentially life-threatening complications. The vascular type of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is also associated with an increased risk of organ rupture, including tearing of the intestine and rupture of the uterus during pregnancy.Other types of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome have additional signs and symptoms. The cardiac-valvular type causes severe problems with the valves that control the movement of blood through the heart. People with the kyphoscoliotic type experience severe curvature of the spine that worsens over time and can interfere with breathing by restricting lung expansion. A type of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome called brittle cornea syndrome is characterized by thinness of the clear covering of the eye (the cornea) and other eye abnormalities. The spondylodysplastic type features short stature and skeletal abnormalities such as abnormally curved (bowed) limbs. Abnormalities of muscles, including hypotonia and permanently bent joints (contractures), are among the characteristic signs of the musculocontractural and myopathic forms of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. The periodontal type causes abnormalities of the teeth and gums.","type":"Disease","xrefs":["{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"PS130000\",\"type\":\"Phenotypic series\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"98249\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"ehlers-danlos-syndrome\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Office of Rare Diseases\",\"id\":\"6322\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"SNOMED CT\",\"id\":\"398114001\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"ehlers-danlos-syndrome\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}","{\"db\":\"Office of Rare Diseases\",\"id\":\"6322\",\"ref_field\":\"symbol\"}"],"name":"Ehlers-Danlos syndrome","symbol":"EDS","alternate_symbols":[],"alternate_names":[],"id":"6501","medgen_id":"C0013720"}

The severity of centronuclear myopathy varies among affected individuals, even among members of the same family.People with centronuclear myopathy begin experiencing muscle weakness at any time from birth to early adulthood. The muscle weakness slowly worsens over time and can lead to delayed development of motor skills, such as crawling or walking; muscle pain during exercise; and difficulty walking. Some affected individuals may need wheelchair assistance as the muscles atrophy and weakness becomes more severe. In rare instances, the muscle weakness improves over time.Some people with centronuclear myopathy experience mild to severe breathing problems related to the weakness of muscles needed for breathing. People with centronuclear myopathy may have droopy eyelids (ptosis) and weakness in other facial muscles, including the muscles that control eye movement. People with this condition may also have foot abnormalities, a high arch in the roof of the mouth (high-arched palate), and abnormal side-to-side curvature of the spine (scoliosis). Rarely, individuals with centronuclear myopathy have a weakened heart muscle (cardiomyopathy), disturbances in nerve function (neuropathy), or intellectual disability.A key feature of centronuclear myopathy is the displacement of the nucleus in muscle cells, which can be viewed under a microscope. Normally the nucleus is found at the edges of the rod-shaped muscle cells, but in people with centronuclear myopathy the nucleus is located in the center of these cells. How the change in location of the nucleus affects muscle cell function is unknown.","type":"Disease","xrefs":["{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"PS160150\",\"type\":\"Phenotypic series\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"centronuclear-myopathy\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}"],"name":"Myopathy, centronuclear","alternate_symbols":[],"alternate_names":[],"id":"32291","medgen_id":"CN221282"}

The triggering substances release calcium stores from the sarcoplasmic reticulum and may promote entry of calcium from the myoplasm, causing contracture of skeletal muscles, glycogenolysis, and increased cellular metabolism, resulting in production of heat and excess lactate. Affected individuals experience: acidosis, hypercapnia, tachycardia, hyperthermia, muscle rigidity, compartment syndrome, rhabdomyolysis with subsequent increase in serum creatine kinase (CK) concentration, hyperkalemia with a risk for cardiac arrhythmia or even arrest, and myoglobinuria with a risk for renal failure. In nearly all cases, the first manifestations of MH (tachycardia and tachypnea) occur in the operating room; however, MH may also occur in the early postoperative period. There is mounting evidence that some affected individuals will also develop MH with exercise and/or on exposure to hot environments.

Thickening usually occurs in the interventricular septum, which is the muscular wall that separates the lower left chamber of the heart (the left ventricle) from the lower right chamber (the right ventricle). In some people, thickening of the interventricular septum impedes the flow of oxygen-rich blood from the heart, which may lead to an abnormal heart sound during a heartbeat (heart murmur) and other signs and symptoms of the condition. Other affected individuals do not have physical obstruction of blood flow, but the pumping of blood is less efficient, which can also lead to symptoms of the condition. Cardiac hypertrophy often begins in adolescence or young adulthood, although it can develop at any time throughout life.The symptoms of familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy are variable, even within the same family. Many affected individuals have no symptoms. Other people with familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy may experience chest pain; shortness of breath, especially with physical exertion; a sensation of fluttering or pounding in the chest (palpitations); lightheadedness; dizziness; and fainting.While most people with familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy are symptom-free or have only mild symptoms, this condition can have serious consequences. It can cause abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias) that may be life threatening.

Some infants, when tapped on the nose, extend their head forward and have spasms of the limb and neck muscles. Rarely, infants with hereditary hyperekplexia experience recurrent seizures (epilepsy).The signs and symptoms of hereditary hyperekplexia typically fade by age 1. However, older individuals with hereditary hyperekplexia may still startle easily and have periods of rigidity, which can cause them to fall down.

{"keywords":[],"attribute_content":[],"public_definition":"Paget disease of bone is a disorder that causes bones to grow larger and weaker than normal. Affected bones may be misshapen and easily broken (fractured).The classic form of Paget disease of bone typically appears in middle age or later. It usually occurs in one or a few bones and does not spread from one bone to another. Any bones can be affected, although the disease most commonly affects bones in the spine, pelvis, skull, or legs.Many people with classic Paget disease of bone do not experience any symptoms associated with their bone abnormalities. The disease is often diagnosed unexpectedly by x-rays or laboratory tests done for other reasons. People who develop symptoms are most likely to experience pain. The affected bones may themselves be painful, or pain may be caused by arthritis in nearby joints. Arthritis results when the distortion of bones, particularly weight-bearing bones in the legs, causes extra wear and tear on the joints. Arthritis most frequently affects the knees and hips in people with this disease.Other complications of Paget disease of bone depend on which bones are affected. If the disease occurs in bones of the skull, it can cause an enlarged head, hearing loss, headaches, and dizziness. If the disease affects bones in the spine, it can lead to numbness and tingling (due to pinched nerves) and abnormal spinal curvature. In the leg bones, the disease can cause bowed legs and difficulty walking.A rare type of bone cancer called osteosarcoma has been associated with Paget disease of bone. This type of cancer probably occurs in less than 1 in 1,000 people with this disease.Early-onset Paget disease of bone is a less common form of the disease that appears in a person's teens or twenties. Its features are similar to those of the classic form of the disease, although it is more likely to affect the skull, spine, and ribs (the axial skeleton) and the small bones of the hands. The early-onset form of the disorder is also associated with hearing loss early in life.","type":"Disease","xrefs":["{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"PS167250\",\"type\":\"Phenotypic series\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"280110\"}","{\"db\":\"SNOMED CT\",\"id\":\"2089002\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"Osteitis deformans\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"paget-disease-of-bone\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"PS167250\",\"type\":\"Phenotypic series\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"paget-disease-of-bone\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}"],"name":"Paget disease of bone","symbol":"PDB","alternate_symbols":[],"alternate_names":["Osteitis deformans"],"id":"35362","medgen_id":"C0029401"}

{"keywords":[],"attribute_content":[],"public_definition":"Familial thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection (familial TAAD) involves problems with the aorta, which is the large blood vessel that distributes blood from the heart to the rest of the body. Familial TAAD affects the upper part of the aorta, near the heart. This part of the aorta is called the thoracic aorta because it is located in the chest (thorax). Other vessels that carry blood from the heart to the rest of the body (arteries) can also be affected.In familial TAAD, the aorta can become weakened and stretched (aortic dilatation), which can lead to a bulge in the blood vessel wall (an aneurysm). Aortic dilatation may also lead to a sudden tearing of the layers in the aorta wall (aortic dissection), allowing blood to flow abnormally between the layers. These aortic abnormalities are potentially life-threatening because they can decrease blood flow to other parts of the body such as the brain or other vital organs, or cause the aorta to break open (rupture).The occurrence and timing of these aortic abnormalities vary, even within the same affected family. They can begin in childhood or not occur until late in life. Aortic dilatation is generally the first feature of familial TAAD to develop, although in some affected individuals dissection occurs with little or no aortic dilatation.Aortic aneurysms usually have no symptoms. However, depending on the size, growth rate, and location of these abnormalities, they can cause pain in the jaw, neck, chest, or back; swelling in the arms, neck, or head; difficult or painful swallowing; hoarseness; shortness of breath; wheezing; a chronic cough; or coughing up blood. Aortic dissections usually cause severe, sudden chest or back pain, and may also result in unusually pale skin (pallor), a very faint pulse, numbness or tingling (paresthesias) in one or more limbs, or paralysis.Familial TAAD may not be associated with other signs and symptoms. However, some individuals in affected families show mild features of related conditions called Marfan syndrome or Loeys-Dietz syndrome. These features include tall stature, stretch marks on the skin, an unusually large range of joint movement (joint hypermobility), and either a sunken or protruding chest. Occasionally, people with familial TAAD develop aneurysms in the brain or in the section of the aorta located in the abdomen (abdominal aorta). Some people with familial TAAD have heart abnormalities that are present from birth (congenital). Affected individuals may also have a soft out-pouching in the lower abdomen (inguinal hernia), an abnormal curvature of the spine (scoliosis), or a purplish skin discoloration (livedo reticularis) caused by abnormalities in the tiny blood vessels of the skin (dermal capillaries). However, these conditions are also common in the general population. Depending on the genetic cause of familial TAAD in particular families, they may have an increased risk of developing blockages in smaller arteries, which can lead to heart attack and stroke.","type":"Disease","xrefs":["{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"PS607086\",\"type\":\"Phenotypic series\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"91387\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"91387\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"Familial thoracic aortic aneurysm and aortic dissection\"}","{\"db\":\"CSER_CC_NCGL; University of Washington Medical Center\",\"id\":\"UWMG_7008129\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"Thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections\"}","{\"db\":\"GeneTests\",\"id\":\"3358\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Alliance\",\"id\":\"Thoracic+Aortic+Aneurysms+and+Aortic+Dissections/9386\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"familial-thoracic-aortic-aneurysm-and-dissection\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}"],"name":"Thoracic aortic aneurysm and aortic dissection","symbol":"TAAD","alternate_symbols":["EDS"],"alternate_names":["Familial thoracic aortic aneurysm and aortic dissection","Thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections"],"id":"16634","medgen_id":"C4707243","content":"{\"Citation\":[{\"@Abbrev\":\"GeneReviews\",\"@Type\":\"review\",\"ID\":[{\"$\":\"20301299\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"},{\"$\":\"NBK1120\",\"@Source\":\"BookShelf\"}]},{\"@Abbrev\":\"CCS, 2014\",\"@Type\":\"practice guideline\",\"ID\":{\"$\":\"24882528\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"}},{\"@Abbrev\":\"ESC, 2014\",\"@Type\":\"practice guideline\",\"ID\":{\"$\":\"25173340\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"}}]}"}

{"keywords":[],"attribute_content":[],"public_definition":"Primary ciliary dyskinesia is a disorder characterized by chronic respiratory tract infections, abnormally positioned internal organs, and the inability to have children (infertility). The signs and symptoms of this condition are caused by abnormal cilia and flagella. Cilia are microscopic, finger-like projections that stick out from the surface of cells. They are found in the linings of the airway, the reproductive system, and other organs and tissues. Flagella are tail-like structures, similar to cilia, that propel sperm cells forward.In the respiratory tract, cilia move back and forth in a coordinated way to move mucus towards the throat. This movement of mucus helps to eliminate fluid, bacteria, and particles from the lungs. Most babies with primary ciliary dyskinesia experience breathing problems at birth, which suggests that cilia play an important role in clearing fetal fluid from the lungs. Beginning in early childhood, affected individuals develop frequent respiratory tract infections. Without properly functioning cilia in the airway, bacteria remain in the respiratory tract and cause infection. People with primary ciliary dyskinesia also have year-round nasal congestion and a chronic cough. Chronic respiratory tract infections can result in a condition called bronchiectasis, which damages the passages, called bronchi, leading from the windpipe to the lungs and can cause life-threatening breathing problems.Some individuals with primary ciliary dyskinesia have abnormally placed organs within their chest and abdomen. These abnormalities arise early in embryonic development when the differences between the left and right sides of the body are established. About 50 percent of people with primary ciliary dyskinesia have a mirror-image reversal of their internal organs (situs inversus totalis). For example, in these individuals the heart is on the right side of the body instead of on the left. Situs inversus totalis does not cause any apparent health problems. When someone with primary ciliary dyskinesia has situs inversus totalis, they are often said to have Kartagener syndrome.Approximately 12 percent of people with primary ciliary dyskinesia have a condition known as heterotaxy syndrome or situs ambiguus, which is characterized by abnormalities of the heart, liver, intestines, or spleen. These organs may be structurally abnormal or improperly positioned. In addition, affected individuals may lack a spleen (asplenia) or have multiple spleens (polysplenia). Heterotaxy syndrome results from problems establishing the left and right sides of the body during embryonic development. The severity of heterotaxy varies widely among affected individuals.Primary ciliary dyskinesia can also lead to infertility. Vigorous movements of the flagella are necessary to propel the sperm cells forward to the female egg cell. Because their sperm do not move properly, males with primary ciliary dyskinesia are usually unable to father children. Infertility occurs in some affected females and is likely due to abnormal cilia in the fallopian tubes.Another feature of primary ciliary dyskinesia is recurrent ear infections (otitis media), especially in young children. Otitis media can lead to permanent hearing loss if untreated. The ear infections are likely related to abnormal cilia within the inner ear.Rarely, individuals with primary ciliary dyskinesia have an accumulation of fluid in the brain (hydrocephalus), likely due to abnormal cilia in the brain.","type":"Disease","xrefs":["{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"612518\",\"type\":\"MIM\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"244\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"612517.0001\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"CILIARY DYSKINESIA, PRIMARY, 10, WITH OR WITHOUT SITUS INVERSUS\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"612518\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"CILIARY DYSKINESIA, PRIMARY, 10, WITH OR WITHOUT SITUS INVERSUS\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Alliance\",\"id\":\"Ciliary+dyskinesia%2C+primary%2C+10/7980\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"primary-ciliary-dyskinesia\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"612518\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"symbol\"}"],"name":"Ciliary dyskinesia, primary, 10","symbol":"CILD10","alternate_symbols":[],"alternate_names":["CILIARY DYSKINESIA, PRIMARY, 10, WITH OR WITHOUT SITUS INVERSUS"],"id":"972","medgen_id":"C2675867","content":"{\"Citation\":{\"@Abbrev\":\"GeneReviews\",\"@Type\":\"review\",\"ID\":[{\"$\":\"20301301\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"},{\"$\":\"NBK1122\",\"@Source\":\"BookShelf\"}]}}"}

{"keywords":[],"attribute_content":[],"public_definition":"Familial thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection (familial TAAD) involves problems with the aorta, which is the large blood vessel that distributes blood from the heart to the rest of the body. Familial TAAD affects the upper part of the aorta, near the heart. This part of the aorta is called the thoracic aorta because it is located in the chest (thorax). Other vessels that carry blood from the heart to the rest of the body (arteries) can also be affected.In familial TAAD, the aorta can become weakened and stretched (aortic dilatation), which can lead to a bulge in the blood vessel wall (an aneurysm). Aortic dilatation may also lead to a sudden tearing of the layers in the aorta wall (aortic dissection), allowing blood to flow abnormally between the layers. These aortic abnormalities are potentially life-threatening because they can decrease blood flow to other parts of the body such as the brain or other vital organs, or cause the aorta to break open (rupture).The occurrence and timing of these aortic abnormalities vary, even within the same affected family. They can begin in childhood or not occur until late in life. Aortic dilatation is generally the first feature of familial TAAD to develop, although in some affected individuals dissection occurs with little or no aortic dilatation.Aortic aneurysms usually have no symptoms. However, depending on the size, growth rate, and location of these abnormalities, they can cause pain in the jaw, neck, chest, or back; swelling in the arms, neck, or head; difficult or painful swallowing; hoarseness; shortness of breath; wheezing; a chronic cough; or coughing up blood. Aortic dissections usually cause severe, sudden chest or back pain, and may also result in unusually pale skin (pallor), a very faint pulse, numbness or tingling (paresthesias) in one or more limbs, or paralysis.Familial TAAD may not be associated with other signs and symptoms. However, some individuals in affected families show mild features of related conditions called Marfan syndrome or Loeys-Dietz syndrome. These features include tall stature, stretch marks on the skin, an unusually large range of joint movement (joint hypermobility), and either a sunken or protruding chest. Occasionally, people with familial TAAD develop aneurysms in the brain or in the section of the aorta located in the abdomen (abdominal aorta). Some people with familial TAAD have heart abnormalities that are present from birth (congenital). Affected individuals may also have a soft out-pouching in the lower abdomen (inguinal hernia), an abnormal curvature of the spine (scoliosis), or a purplish skin discoloration (livedo reticularis) caused by abnormalities in the tiny blood vessels of the skin (dermal capillaries). However, these conditions are also common in the general population. Depending on the genetic cause of familial TAAD in particular families, they may have an increased risk of developing blockages in smaller arteries, which can lead to heart attack and stroke.","type":"Disease","xrefs":["{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"611788\",\"type\":\"MIM\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"611788\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"FAMILIAL THORACIC AORTIC ANEURYSM WITH LIVEDO RETICULARIS AND IRIS FLOCCULI\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Alliance\",\"id\":\"Aortic+aneurysm%2C+familial+thoracic+6/7699\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"familial-thoracic-aortic-aneurysm-and-dissection\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"611788\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"symbol\"}"],"name":"Aortic aneurysm, familial thoracic 6","symbol":"AAT6","alternate_symbols":["MFS"],"alternate_names":["FAMILIAL THORACIC AORTIC ANEURYSM WITH LIVEDO RETICULARIS AND IRIS FLOCCULI"],"id":"320","medgen_id":"C2673186","content":"{\"Citation\":[{\"@Abbrev\":\"GeneReviews\",\"@Type\":\"review\",\"ID\":[{\"$\":\"20301299\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"},{\"$\":\"NBK1120\",\"@Source\":\"BookShelf\"}]},{\"@Abbrev\":\"ACMG, 2013\",\"@Type\":\"Recommendation\",\"ID\":{\"$\":\"23788249\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"}},{\"@Abbrev\":\"CCS, 2014\",\"@Type\":\"practice guideline\",\"ID\":{\"$\":\"24882528\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"}},{\"@Abbrev\":\"ESC, 2014\",\"@Type\":\"practice guideline\",\"ID\":{\"$\":\"25173340\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"}},{\"@Abbrev\":\"ACMG, 2015\",\"@Type\":\"Recommendation\",\"ID\":{\"$\":\"25356965\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"}},{\"@Abbrev\":\"ACMG, 2016\",\"@Type\":\"Recommendation\",\"ID\":[{\"$\":\"27854360\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"},{\"$\":\"10.1038/gim.2016.190\",\"@Source\":\"DOI\"}]}]}"}

{"keywords":[],"attribute_content":[],"public_definition":"Hereditary hyperekplexia is a condition in which affected infants have increased muscle tone (hypertonia) and an exaggerated startle reaction to unexpected stimuli, especially loud noises. Following the startle reaction, infants experience a brief period in which they are very rigid and unable to move. During these rigid periods, some infants stop breathing, which, if prolonged, can be fatal. Infants with hereditary hyperekplexia have hypertonia at all times, except when they are sleeping.Other signs and symptoms of hereditary hyperekplexia can include muscle twitches when falling asleep (hypnagogic myoclonus) and movements of the arms or legs while asleep. Some infants, when tapped on the nose, extend their head forward and have spasms of the limb and neck muscles. Rarely, infants with hereditary hyperekplexia experience recurrent seizures (epilepsy).The signs and symptoms of hereditary hyperekplexia typically fade by age 1. However, older individuals with hereditary hyperekplexia may still startle easily and have periods of rigidity, which can cause them to fall down. They may also continue to have hypnagogic myoclonus or movements during sleep. As they get older, individuals with this condition may have a low tolerance for crowded places and loud noises. People with hereditary hyperekplexia who have epilepsy have the seizure disorder throughout their lives.Hereditary hyperekplexia may explain some cases of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), which is a major cause of unexplained death in babies younger than 1 year.","type":"Disease","xrefs":["{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"PS149400\",\"type\":\"Phenotypic series\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"306773\"}","{\"db\":\"GeneTests\",\"id\":\"74148\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"PS149400\",\"type\":\"Phenotypic series\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"hereditary-hyperekplexia\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}"],"name":"Hyperekplexia","alternate_symbols":[],"alternate_names":[],"id":"10190","medgen_id":"C0234166","content":"{\"Citation\":{\"@Abbrev\":\"GeneReviews\",\"@Type\":\"review\",\"ID\":[{\"$\":\"20301437\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"},{\"$\":\"NBK1260\",\"@Source\":\"BookShelf\"}]}}"}

{"keywords":[],"attribute_content":[],"public_definition":"Blepharocheilodontic (BCD) syndrome is a disorder that is present at birth. It mainly affects the eyelids (blepharo-), upper lip (-cheilo-), and teeth (-dontic).People with BCD syndrome have lower eyelids that turn out so that the inner surface is exposed (ectropion). The outside of the lower lid may sag away from the eye (euryblepharon), and the eyelids may not be able to close completely (lagophthalmia). There can be extra eyelashes (distichiasis) on the upper eyelids, ranging from a few extra eyelashes to a full extra set. These eyelashes do not grow along the edge of the eyelid with the normal lashes, but out of its inner lining. When the abnormal eyelashes touch the eyeball, they can cause damage to the clear covering of the eye (cornea). Affected individuals may also have widely spaced eyes (hypertelorism), a flat face, and a high forehead.Other features of BCD syndrome usually include openings on both sides of the upper lip (bilateral cleft lip) and an opening in the roof of the mouth (cleft palate). Affected individuals may have fewer teeth than normal (oligodontia) and their teeth are often smaller than usual and cone-shaped. The dental abnormalities affect both primary teeth (sometimes called \"baby teeth\") and secondary (permanent) teeth. Other frequent features include sparse, fine hair and abnormal nails.Occasionally people with BCD syndrome have additional features, including an obstruction of the anal opening (imperforate anus); malformation or absence of the butterfly-shaped gland in the lower neck called the thyroid, resulting in lack of thyroid gland function; or fused fingers or toes (syndactyly). Very rarely, affected individuals have incompletely formed arms or legs (limb reduction defects) or a spinal cord abnormality known as spina bifida.","type":"Disease","xrefs":["{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"617681\",\"type\":\"MIM\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"blepharocheilodontic-syndrome\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"617681\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"symbol\"}"],"name":"Blepharocheilodontic syndrome 2","symbol":"BCDS2","alternate_symbols":[],"alternate_names":[],"id":"38126","medgen_id":"C4540127"}

{"keywords":[],"attribute_content":[],"public_definition":"Hereditary hyperekplexia is a condition in which affected infants have increased muscle tone (hypertonia) and an exaggerated startle reaction to unexpected stimuli, especially loud noises. Following the startle reaction, infants experience a brief period in which they are very rigid and unable to move. During these rigid periods, some infants stop breathing, which, if prolonged, can be fatal. Infants with hereditary hyperekplexia have hypertonia at all times, except when they are sleeping.Other signs and symptoms of hereditary hyperekplexia can include muscle twitches when falling asleep (hypnagogic myoclonus) and movements of the arms or legs while asleep. Some infants, when tapped on the nose, extend their head forward and have spasms of the limb and neck muscles. Rarely, infants with hereditary hyperekplexia experience recurrent seizures (epilepsy).The signs and symptoms of hereditary hyperekplexia typically fade by age 1. However, older individuals with hereditary hyperekplexia may still startle easily and have periods of rigidity, which can cause them to fall down. They may also continue to have hypnagogic myoclonus or movements during sleep. As they get older, individuals with this condition may have a low tolerance for crowded places and loud noises. People with hereditary hyperekplexia who have epilepsy have the seizure disorder throughout their lives.Hereditary hyperekplexia may explain some cases of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), which is a major cause of unexplained death in babies younger than 1 year.","type":"Disease","xrefs":["{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"614618\",\"type\":\"MIM\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"3197\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"604159.0008\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"HYPEREKPLEXIA 3, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"604159.0001\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"HYPEREKPLEXIA 3, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"604159.0002\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"HYPEREKPLEXIA 3, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"604159.0003\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"HYPEREKPLEXIA 3, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"604159.0004\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"HYPEREKPLEXIA 3, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"604159.0005\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"HYPEREKPLEXIA 3, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"604159.0006\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"HYPEREKPLEXIA 3, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"604159.0007\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"HYPEREKPLEXIA 3, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Alliance\",\"id\":\"HYPEREKPLEXIA+3/8586\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"hereditary-hyperekplexia\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"614618\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"symbol\"}"],"name":"Hyperekplexia 3","symbol":"HKPX3","alternate_symbols":[],"alternate_names":["HYPEREKPLEXIA 3, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT","HYPEREKPLEXIA 3, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE"],"id":"16959","medgen_id":"C3553288","content":"{\"Citation\":{\"@Abbrev\":\"GeneReviews\",\"@Type\":\"review\",\"ID\":[{\"$\":\"20301437\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"},{\"$\":\"NBK1260\",\"@Source\":\"BookShelf\"}]}}"}

The disease usually begins in the third to fifth decade in persons from endemic foci in Portugal and Japan; onset is later in persons from other areas. Typically, sensory neuropathy starts in the lower extremities with paresthesias and hypesthesias of the feet, followed within a few years by motor neuropathy. In some persons, particularly those with early-onset disease, autonomic neuropathy is the first manifestation of the condition; findings can include: orthostatic hypotension, constipation alternating with diarrhea, attacks of nausea and vomiting, delayed gastric emptying, sexual impotence, anhidrosis, and urinary retention or incontinence. Cardiac amyloidosis is mainly characterized by progressive cardiomyopathy.

The most common auditory symptoms are simple unformed sounds including humming, buzzing, or ringing; less common forms are distortions (e.g., volume changes) or complex sounds (e.g., specific songs or voices). Ictal receptive aphasia consists of a sudden onset of inability to understand language in the absence of general confusion. Less commonly, other ictal symptoms may occur, including sensory symptoms (visual, olfactory, vertiginous, or cephalic) or motor, psychic, and autonomic symptoms. Most affected individuals have focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizures, usually accompanied by \"focal aware\" and \"focal impaired-awareness\" seizures, with auditory symptoms as a major focal aware seizure manifestation. Some persons have seizures precipitated by sounds such as a ringing telephone. Age at onset is usually in adolescence or early adulthood (range: age 4-50 years). The clinical course of ADEAF is benign. Seizures are usually well controlled after initiation of medical therapy.","type":"Disease","xrefs":["{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"600512\",\"type\":\"MIM\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"101046\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Alliance\",\"id\":\"Autosomal+Dominant+Partial+Epilepsy+with+Auditory+Features/688\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"Epilepsy, lateral temporal lobe, autosomal dominant\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"600512\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_symbols\",\"ref_field_element\":\"ADLTE\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"600512\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_symbols\",\"ref_field_element\":\"ADPEAF\"}","{\"db\":\"GeneReviews\",\"id\":\"NBK1537\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"600512\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"symbol\"}"],"name":"Familial temporal lobe epilepsy 1","symbol":"ETL1","alternate_symbols":["ADLTE","ADPEAF"],"alternate_names":["Epilepsy, lateral temporal lobe, autosomal dominant"],"id":"2102","medgen_id":"C4551957","content":"{\"Citation\":{\"@Abbrev\":\"GeneReviews\",\"@Type\":\"review\",\"ID\":[{\"$\":\"20301709\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"},{\"$\":\"NBK1537\",\"@Source\":\"BookShelf\"}]}}"}

{"keywords":[],"attribute_content":[],"public_definition":"Familial thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection (familial TAAD) involves problems with the aorta, which is the large blood vessel that distributes blood from the heart to the rest of the body. Familial TAAD affects the upper part of the aorta, near the heart. This part of the aorta is called the thoracic aorta because it is located in the chest (thorax). Other vessels that carry blood from the heart to the rest of the body (arteries) can also be affected.In familial TAAD, the aorta can become weakened and stretched (aortic dilatation), which can lead to a bulge in the blood vessel wall (an aneurysm). Aortic dilatation may also lead to a sudden tearing of the layers in the aorta wall (aortic dissection), allowing blood to flow abnormally between the layers. These aortic abnormalities are potentially life-threatening because they can decrease blood flow to other parts of the body such as the brain or other vital organs, or cause the aorta to break open (rupture).The occurrence and timing of these aortic abnormalities vary, even within the same affected family. They can begin in childhood or not occur until late in life. Aortic dilatation is generally the first feature of familial TAAD to develop, although in some affected individuals dissection occurs with little or no aortic dilatation.Aortic aneurysms usually have no symptoms. However, depending on the size, growth rate, and location of these abnormalities, they can cause pain in the jaw, neck, chest, or back; swelling in the arms, neck, or head; difficult or painful swallowing; hoarseness; shortness of breath; wheezing; a chronic cough; or coughing up blood. Aortic dissections usually cause severe, sudden chest or back pain, and may also result in unusually pale skin (pallor), a very faint pulse, numbness or tingling (paresthesias) in one or more limbs, or paralysis.Familial TAAD may not be associated with other signs and symptoms. However, some individuals in affected families show mild features of related conditions called Marfan syndrome or Loeys-Dietz syndrome. These features include tall stature, stretch marks on the skin, an unusually large range of joint movement (joint hypermobility), and either a sunken or protruding chest. Occasionally, people with familial TAAD develop aneurysms in the brain or in the section of the aorta located in the abdomen (abdominal aorta). Some people with familial TAAD have heart abnormalities that are present from birth (congenital). Affected individuals may also have a soft out-pouching in the lower abdomen (inguinal hernia), an abnormal curvature of the spine (scoliosis), or a purplish skin discoloration (livedo reticularis) caused by abnormalities in the tiny blood vessels of the skin (dermal capillaries). However, these conditions are also common in the general population. Depending on the genetic cause of familial TAAD in particular families, they may have an increased risk of developing blockages in smaller arteries, which can lead to heart attack and stroke.","type":"Disease","xrefs":["{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"132900\",\"type\":\"MIM\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"132900\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_symbols\",\"ref_field_element\":\"FAA4\"}","{\"db\":\"Office of Rare Diseases\",\"id\":\"9876\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_symbols\",\"ref_field_element\":\"FAA4\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Alliance\",\"id\":\"Aortic+Aneurysm%2C+Familial+Thoracic+4/532\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Office of Rare Diseases\",\"id\":\"9876\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"familial-thoracic-aortic-aneurysm-and-dissection\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"132900\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"symbol\"}","{\"db\":\"Office of Rare Diseases\",\"id\":\"9876\",\"ref_field\":\"symbol\"}"],"name":"Aortic aneurysm, familial thoracic 4","symbol":"AAT4","alternate_symbols":["FAA4","TSC"],"alternate_names":[],"id":"420","medgen_id":"C1851504","content":"{\"Citation\":[{\"@Abbrev\":\"GeneReviews\",\"@Type\":\"review\",\"ID\":[{\"$\":\"20301299\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"},{\"$\":\"NBK1120\",\"@Source\":\"BookShelf\"}]},{\"@Abbrev\":\"ACMG, 2013\",\"@Type\":\"Recommendation\",\"ID\":{\"$\":\"23788249\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"}},{\"@Abbrev\":\"CCS, 2014\",\"@Type\":\"practice guideline\",\"ID\":{\"$\":\"24882528\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"}},{\"@Abbrev\":\"ESC, 2014\",\"@Type\":\"practice guideline\",\"ID\":{\"$\":\"25173340\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"}},{\"@Abbrev\":\"ACMG, 2015\",\"@Type\":\"Recommendation\",\"ID\":{\"$\":\"25356965\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"}},{\"@Abbrev\":\"ACMG, 2016\",\"@Type\":\"Recommendation\",\"ID\":[{\"$\":\"27854360\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"},{\"$\":\"10.1038/gim.2016.190\",\"@Source\":\"DOI\"}]}]}"}

Other chronic skin findings include milia, scarring, thickening, and areas of decreased and increased skin pigmentation. Facial hyperpigmentation and hypertrichosis may occur. Cutaneous manifestations may improve in winter and be less prevalent in northern regions and in dark-skinned individuals. Acute neurovisceral symptoms can occur any time after puberty, but less often in the elderly. Acute manifestations are highly variable, but may be similar from episode to episode in a person with recurrent attacks; not all manifestations are present in a single episode; and acute symptoms may become chronic. Symptoms are more common in women than men. The most common manifestations are abdominal pain; constipation; pain in the back, chest, and extremities; anxiety; seizures; and a primarily motor neuropathy resulting in muscle weakness that may progress to quadriparesis and respiratory paralysis. Psychiatric disturbances and autonomic neuropathy can also be observed.

CYP2C19 ultrarapid and rapid metabolizers may have increased metabolism of the drug, resulting in a reduced likelihood of attaining therapeutic voriconazole concentrations, while poor metabolizers may have decreased metabolism of the drug, resulting in an increased likelihood for adverse effects. Therapeutic guidelines for voriconazole based on CYP2C19 genotype have been published in Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics by the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) and are available on the PharmGKB website (https://www.pharmgkb.org/guideline/PA166161537).","type":"DrugResponse","xrefs":[],"name":"Voriconazole response","alternate_symbols":[],"alternate_names":["Vfend response"],"id":"16405","medgen_id":"CN077957","content":"{\"Citation\":[{\"@Abbrev\":\"CPIC, 2016\",\"@Type\":\"practice guideline\",\"ID\":[{\"$\":\"27981572\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"},{\"$\":\"5474211\",\"@Source\":\"pmc\"}]},{\"@Abbrev\":\"Medical Genetics Summaries\",\"@Type\":\"review\",\"ID\":{\"$\":\"NBK552035\",\"@Source\":\"BookShelf\"}},{\"@Abbrev\":\"DailyMed Drug Label, 2015\",\"@Type\":\"practice guideline\",\"CitationText\":{\"$\":\"DailyMed Drug Label, VFEND, 2015\"},\"URL\":{\"$\":\"https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/lookup.cfm?setid=ce3ef5cf-3087-4d92-9d94-9eb8287228db\"}}]}"}

{"keywords":[],"attribute_content":[],"public_definition":"Mitochondrial diseases are a clinically heterogeneous group of disorders that arise as a result of dysfunction of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. They can be caused by mutation of genes encoded by either nuclear DNA or mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). While some mitochondrial disorders only affect a single organ (e.g., the eye in Leber hereditary optic neuropathy [LHON]), many involve multiple organ systems and often present with prominent neurologic and myopathic features. Mitochondrial disorders may present at any age. Many individuals with a mutation of mtDNA display a cluster of clinical features that fall into a discrete clinical syndrome, such as the Kearns-Sayre syndrome (KSS), chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO), mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS), myoclonic epilepsy with ragged-red fibers (MERRF), neurogenic weakness with ataxia and retinitis pigmentosa (NARP), or Leigh syndrome (LS). However, considerable clinical variability exists and many individuals do not fit neatly into one particular category, which is well-illustrated by the overlapping spectrum of disease phenotypes (including mitochondrial recessive ataxia syndrome (MIRAS) resulting from mutation of the nuclear gene POLG, which has emerged as a major cause of mitochondrial disease. Common clinical features of mitochondrial disease – whether involving a mitochondrial or nuclear gene – include ptosis, external ophthalmoplegia, proximal myopathy and exercise intolerance, cardiomyopathy, sensorineural deafness, optic atrophy, pigmentary retinopathy, and diabetes mellitus. Common central nervous system findings are fluctuating encephalopathy, seizures, dementia, migraine, stroke-like episodes, ataxia, and spasticity. A high incidence of mid- and late pregnancy loss is a common occurrence that often goes unrecognized.","type":"Disease","xrefs":["{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"68380\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Alliance\",\"id\":\"Mitochondrial+Disorders/4830\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"GeneReviews\",\"id\":\"NBK1224\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}"],"name":"Mitochondrial diseases","alternate_symbols":[],"alternate_names":[],"id":"9530","medgen_id":"C0751651","content":"{\"Citation\":[{\"@Abbrev\":\"GeneReviews\",\"@Type\":\"review\",\"ID\":[{\"$\":\"20301403\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"},{\"$\":\"NBK1224\",\"@Source\":\"BookShelf\"}]},{\"@Abbrev\":\"MMS, 2014\",\"@Type\":\"Position Statement\",\"ID\":{\"$\":\"25503498\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"}}]}"}

TdP is usually self-terminating, thus causing a syncopal event, the most common symptom in individuals with LQTS. Such cardiac events typically occur during exercise and emotional stress, less frequently during sleep, and usually without warning. In some instances, TdP degenerates to ventricular fibrillation and causes aborted cardiac arrest (if the individual is defibrillated) or sudden death. Approximately 50% of untreated individuals with a pathogenic variant in one of the genes associated with LQTS have symptoms, usually one to a few syncopal events. While cardiac events may occur from infancy through middle age, they are most common from the preteen years through the 20s. Some types of LQTS are associated with a phenotype extending beyond cardiac arrhythmia. In addition to the prolonged QT interval, associations include muscle weakness and facial dysmorphism in Andersen-Tawil syndrome (LQTS type 7); hand/foot, facial, and neurodevelopmental features in Timothy syndrome (LQTS type 8); and profound sensorineural hearing loss in Jervell and Lange-Nielson syndrome.","type":"Disease","xrefs":["{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"101016\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000558497\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_symbols\",\"ref_field_element\":\"LQT1\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"192500\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_symbols\",\"ref_field_element\":\"WRS\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Alliance\",\"id\":\"6529\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Alliance\",\"id\":\"Romano-Ward+syndrome/9638\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"romano-ward-syndrome\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Office of Rare Diseases\",\"id\":\"3284\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"SNOMED CT\",\"id\":\"20852007\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"GeneReviews\",\"id\":\"NBK1129\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"192500\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"symbol\"}"],"name":"Romano-Ward syndrome","symbol":"RWS","alternate_symbols":["LQT1","WRS"],"alternate_names":[],"id":"16707","medgen_id":"C0035828","content":"{\"Citation\":{\"@Abbrev\":\"GeneReviews\",\"@Type\":\"review\",\"ID\":[{\"$\":\"20301308\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"},{\"$\":\"NBK1129\",\"@Source\":\"BookShelf\"}]}}"}
{"keywords":[],"attribute_content":[],"public_definition":"Alzheimer disease is a degenerative disease of the brain that causes dementia, which is a gradual loss of memory, judgment, and ability to function. This disorder usually appears in people older than age 65, but less common forms of the disease appear earlier in adulthood.Memory loss is the most common sign of Alzheimer disease. Forgetfulness may be subtle at first, but the loss of memory worsens over time until it interferes with most aspects of daily living. Even in familiar settings, a person with Alzheimer disease may get lost or become confused. Routine tasks such as preparing meals, doing laundry, and performing other household chores can be challenging. Additionally, it may become difficult to recognize people and name objects. Affected people increasingly require help with dressing, eating, and personal care.As the disorder progresses, some people with Alzheimer disease experience personality and behavioral changes and have trouble interacting in a socially appropriate manner. Other common symptoms include agitation, restlessness, withdrawal, and loss of language skills. People with this disease usually require total care during the advanced stages of the disease.Affected individuals usually survive 8 to 10 years after the appearance of symptoms, but the course of the disease can range from 1 to 25 years. Survival is usually shorter in individuals diagnosed after age 80 than in those diagnosed at a younger age. Death usually results from pneumonia, malnutrition, or general body wasting (inanition).Alzheimer disease can be classified as early-onset or late-onset. The signs and symptoms of the early-onset form appear between a person's thirties and mid-sixties, while the late-onset form appears during or after a person's mid-sixties. The early-onset form is much less common than the late-onset form, accounting for less than 10 percent of all cases of Alzheimer disease.","type":"Disease","xrefs":["{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"104310\",\"type\":\"MIM\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"1020\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"104310\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"ALZHEIMER DISEASE 2, LATE-ONSET\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"104310\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"ALZHEIMER DISEASE ASSOCIATED WITH APOE4\"}","{\"db\":\"Office of Rare Diseases\",\"id\":\"9467\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_symbols\",\"ref_field_element\":\"LOFAD\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Alliance\",\"id\":\"Alzheimer+Disease+Type+2/352\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"alzheimer-disease\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"104310\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"symbol\"}","{\"db\":\"Office of Rare Diseases\",\"id\":\"9467\",\"ref_field\":\"symbol\"}"],"name":"Alzheimer disease 2","symbol":"AD2","alternate_symbols":["LOFAD"],"alternate_names":["ALZHEIMER DISEASE 2, LATE-ONSET","ALZHEIMER DISEASE ASSOCIATED WITH APOE4"],"id":"284","medgen_id":"C1863051","content":"{\"Citation\":[{\"@Abbrev\":\"EFNS, 2010\",\"@Type\":\"practice guideline\",\"ID\":{\"$\":\"20831773\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"}},{\"@Abbrev\":\"AHRQ, 2010\",\"@Type\":\"Position Statement\",\"ID\":{\"$\":\"21500874\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"}},{\"@Abbrev\":\"ACMG/NSGC, 2011\",\"@Type\":\"practice guideline\",\"ID\":{\"$\":\"3326653\",\"@Source\":\"pmc\"}},{\"@Abbrev\":\"EFNS, 2010\",\"@Type\":\"practice guideline\",\"ID\":{\"$\":\"20298421\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"}},{\"@Abbrev\":\"CCCDTD, 2014\",\"@Type\":\"Recommendation\",\"ID\":{\"$\":\"24829003\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"}}]}"}

Age of onset, severity, and progression of muscle and cardiac involvement demonstrate both inter- and intrafamilial variability. Clinical variability ranges from early onset with severe presentation in childhood to late onset with slow progression in adulthood.

{"keywords":[],"attribute_content":[],"public_definition":"Familial dilated cardiomyopathy is a genetic form of heart disease. It occurs when heart (cardiac) muscle becomes thin and weakened in at least one chamber of the heart, causing the open area of the chamber to become enlarged (dilated). As a result, the heart is unable to pump blood as efficiently as usual. To compensate, the heart attempts to increase the amount of blood being pumped through the heart, leading to further thinning and weakening of the cardiac muscle. Over time, this condition results in heart failure.It usually takes many years for symptoms of familial dilated cardiomyopathy to cause health problems. They typically begin in mid-adulthood, but can occur at any time from infancy to late adulthood. Signs and symptoms of familial dilated cardiomyopathy can include an irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia), shortness of breath (dyspnea), extreme tiredness (fatigue), fainting episodes (syncope), and swelling of the legs and feet. In some cases, the first sign of the disorder is sudden cardiac death. The severity of the condition varies among affected individuals, even in members of the same family.","type":"Disease","xrefs":["{\"db\":\"EFO\",\"id\":\"EFO_0000407\"}","{\"db\":\"Human Phenotype Ontology\",\"id\":\"HP:0001644\",\"type\":\"primary\"}","{\"db\":\"Human Phenotype Ontology\",\"id\":\"HP:0001725\",\"type\":\"secondary\"}","{\"db\":\"Human Phenotype Ontology\",\"id\":\"HP:0005159\",\"type\":\"secondary\"}","{\"db\":\"Human Phenotype Ontology\",\"id\":\"HP:0200130\",\"type\":\"secondary\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"217604\"}","{\"db\":\"Human Phenotype Ontology\",\"id\":\"HP:0001644\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"Congestive cardiomyopathy\"}","{\"db\":\"SNOMED CT\",\"id\":\"195021004\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"familial-dilated-cardiomyopathy\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}","{\"db\":\"Office of Rare Diseases\",\"id\":\"221\",\"ref_field\":\"symbol\"}"],"name":"Primary dilated cardiomyopathy","symbol":"DCM","alternate_symbols":[],"alternate_names":["Congestive cardiomyopathy"],"id":"676","mode_of_inheritance":"Various modes of inheritance","medgen_id":"C0007193","content":"{\"Citation\":[{\"@Type\":\"review\",\"ID\":{\"$\":\"16839424\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"}},{\"@Abbrev\":\"GeneReviews\",\"@Type\":\"review\",\"ID\":[{\"$\":\"20301486\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"},{\"$\":\"NBK1309\",\"@Source\":\"BookShelf\"}]},{\"@Abbrev\":\"AHRQ, 2013\",\"@Type\":\"practice guideline\",\"ID\":{\"$\":\"NBK248310\",\"@Source\":\"BookShelf\"}},{\"@Abbrev\":\"HRS/EHRA, 2012\",\"@Type\":\"Recommendation\",\"ID\":{\"$\":\"21810866\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"}}]}"}
{"keywords":[],"attribute_content":[],"public_definition":"VLDLR-associated cerebellar hypoplasia is an inherited condition that affects the development of the brain. People with this condition have an unusually small and underdeveloped cerebellum, which is the part of the brain that coordinates movement. This brain malformation leads to problems with balance and coordination (ataxia) that become apparent in infancy and remain stable over time. Children with VLDLR-associated cerebellar hypoplasia may learn to walk later in childhood, usually after the age of 6, although some are never able to walk independently. In one Turkish family, affected people walk on their hands and feet (quadrupedal locomotion).Additional features of VLDLR-associated cerebellar hypoplasia include moderate to profound intellectual disability, impaired speech (dysarthria) or a lack of speech, and eyes that do not look in the same direction (strabismus). Some affected individuals have also had flat feet (pes planus), seizures, and short stature. Studies suggest that VLDLR-associated cerebellar hypoplasia does not significantly affect a person's life expectancy.","type":"Disease","xrefs":["{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"PS224050\",\"type\":\"Phenotypic series\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"1766\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"PS224050\",\"type\":\"Phenotypic series\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"Cerebellar ataxia, mental retardation, and dysequilibrium\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"224050\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_symbols\",\"ref_field_element\":\"DES\"}","{\"db\":\"Office of Rare Diseases\",\"id\":\"1998\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_symbols\",\"ref_field_element\":\"DES\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Alliance\",\"id\":\"Dysequilibrium+Syndrome/2374\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Office of Rare Diseases\",\"id\":\"1998\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"SNOMED CT\",\"id\":\"230782004\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"vldlr-associated-cerebellar-hypoplasia\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}"],"name":"Dysequilibrium syndrome","alternate_symbols":["DES"],"alternate_names":["Cerebellar ataxia, mental retardation, and dysequilibrium"],"id":"35613","medgen_id":"C0394006"}
{"keywords":[],"attribute_content":[],"public_definition":"Alzheimer disease is a degenerative disease of the brain that causes dementia, which is a gradual loss of memory, judgment, and ability to function. This disorder usually appears in people older than age 65, but less common forms of the disease appear earlier in adulthood.Memory loss is the most common sign of Alzheimer disease. Forgetfulness may be subtle at first, but the loss of memory worsens over time until it interferes with most aspects of daily living. Even in familiar settings, a person with Alzheimer disease may get lost or become confused. Routine tasks such as preparing meals, doing laundry, and performing other household chores can be challenging. Additionally, it may become difficult to recognize people and name objects. Affected people increasingly require help with dressing, eating, and personal care.As the disorder progresses, some people with Alzheimer disease experience personality and behavioral changes and have trouble interacting in a socially appropriate manner. Other common symptoms include agitation, restlessness, withdrawal, and loss of language skills. People with this disease usually require total care during the advanced stages of the disease.Affected individuals usually survive 8 to 10 years after the appearance of symptoms, but the course of the disease can range from 1 to 25 years. Survival is usually shorter in individuals diagnosed after age 80 than in those diagnosed at a younger age. Death usually results from pneumonia, malnutrition, or general body wasting (inanition).Alzheimer disease can be classified as early-onset or late-onset. The signs and symptoms of the early-onset form appear between a person's thirties and mid-sixties, while the late-onset form appears during or after a person's mid-sixties. The early-onset form is much less common than the late-onset form, accounting for less than 10 percent of all cases of Alzheimer disease.","type":"Disease","xrefs":["{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"607822\",\"type\":\"MIM\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"1020\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"104311.0001\",\"type\":\"Allelic

This damage can lead to reduction in side (peripheral) vision and eventual blindness. Other signs and symptoms may include bulging eyes, excessive tearing, and abnormal sensitivity to light (photophobia). The term \"early-onset glaucoma\" may be used when the disorder appears before the age of 40.In most people with glaucoma, the damage to the optic nerves is caused by increased pressure within the eyes (intraocular pressure). Intraocular pressure depends on a balance between fluid entering and leaving the eyes.Usually glaucoma develops in older adults, in whom the risk of developing the disorder may be affected by a variety of medical conditions including high blood pressure (hypertension) and diabetes mellitus, as well as family history. The risk of early-onset glaucoma depends mainly on heredity.Structural abnormalities that impede fluid drainage in the eye may be present at birth and usually become apparent during the first year of life. Such abnormalities may be part of a genetic disorder that affects many body systems, called a syndrome. If glaucoma appears before the age of 5 without other associated abnormalities, it is called primary congenital glaucoma.Other individuals experience early onset of primary open-angle glaucoma, the most common adult form of glaucoma. If primary open-angle glaucoma develops during childhood or early adulthood, it is called juvenile open-angle glaucoma.","type":"Disease","xrefs":["{\"db\":\"Human Phenotype Ontology\",\"id\":\"HP:0001087\",\"type\":\"primary\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"98976\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"early-onset-glaucoma\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}"],"name":"Congenital glaucoma","alternate_symbols":[],"alternate_names":["Childhood glaucoma","Infantile glaucoma","Pediatric glaucoma"],"id":"22162","medgen_id":"C2981140"}

{"keywords":[],"ghr_links":"mitochondrial complex V deficiency","attribute_content":[],"public_definition":"Mitochondrial complex V deficiency is a shortage (deficiency) of a protein complex called complex V or a loss of its function. Complex V is found in cell structures called mitochondria, which convert the energy from food into a form that cells can use. Complex V is the last of five mitochondrial complexes that carry out a multistep process called oxidative phosphorylation, through which cells derive much of their energy.Mitochondrial complex V deficiency can cause a wide variety of signs and symptoms affecting many organs and systems of the body, particularly the nervous system and the heart. The disorder can be life-threatening in infancy or early childhood. Affected individuals may have feeding problems, slow growth, low muscle tone (hypotonia), extreme fatigue (lethargy), and developmental delay. They tend to develop elevated levels of lactic acid in the blood (lactic acidosis), which can cause nausea, vomiting, weakness, and rapid breathing. High levels of ammonia in the blood (hyperammonemia) can also occur in affected individuals, and in some cases result in abnormal brain function (encephalopathy) and damage to other organs.Another common feature of mitochondrial complex V deficiency is hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. This condition is characterized by thickening (hypertrophy) of the heart (cardiac) muscle that can lead to heart failure. People with mitochondrial complex V deficiency may also have a characteristic pattern of facial features, including a high forehead, curved eyebrows, outside corners of the eyes that point downward (downslanting palpebral fissures), a prominent bridge of the nose, low-set ears, thin lips, and a small chin (micrognathia).Some people with mitochondrial complex V deficiency have groups of signs and symptoms that are classified as a specific syndrome. For example, mitochondrial complex V deficiency can cause a condition called neuropathy, ataxia, and retinitis pigmentosa (NARP). NARP causes a variety of signs and symptoms chiefly affecting the nervous system. Beginning in childhood or early adulthood, most people with NARP experience numbness, tingling, or pain in the arms and legs (sensory neuropathy); muscle weakness; and problems with balance and coordination (ataxia). Many affected individuals also have cognitive impairment and an eye disorder called retinitis pigmentosa that causes vision loss.A condition called Leigh syndrome can also be caused by mitochondrial complex V deficiency. Leigh syndrome is characterized by progressive loss of mental and movement abilities (developmental or psychomotor regression) and typically results in death within 2 to 3 years after the onset of symptoms. Both NARP and Leigh syndrome can also have other causes.","type":"Disease","xrefs":["{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"PS604273\",\"type\":\"Phenotypic series\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"mitochondrial-complex-v-deficiency\",\"ref_field\":\"ghr_links\"}","{\"db\":\"Illumina Clinical Services Laboratory,Illumina\",\"id\":\"745484\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"mitochondrial-complex-v-deficiency\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}"],"name":"Mitochondrial Complex V (ATP Synthase) Deficiency, Nuclear Type","alternate_symbols":[],"alternate_names":[],"id":"36350","medgen_id":"CN239153"}
{"keywords":[],"attribute_content":[],"public_definition":"Benign familial neonatal seizures (BFNS) is a condition characterized by recurrent seizures in newborn babies. The seizures begin around day 3 of life and usually go away within 1 to 4 months. The seizures can involve only one side of the brain (focal seizures) or both sides (generalized seizures). Many infants with this condition have generalized tonic-clonic seizures (also known as grand mal seizures). This type of seizure involves both sides of the brain and affects the entire body, causing muscle rigidity, convulsions, and loss of consciousness.A test called an electroencephalogram (EEG) is used to measure the electrical activity of the brain. Abnormalities on an EEG test, measured during no seizure activity, can indicate a risk for seizures. However, infants with BFNS usually have normal EEG readings. In some affected individuals, the EEG shows a specific abnormality called the theta pointu alternant pattern. By age 2, most affected individuals who had EEG abnormalities have a normal EEG reading.Typically, seizures are the only symptom of BFNS, and most people with this condition develop normally. However, some affected individuals develop intellectual disability that becomes noticeable in early childhood. A small percentage of people with BFNS also have a condition called myokymia, which is an involuntary rippling movement of the muscles. In addition, in about 15 percent of people with BFNS, recurrent seizures (epilepsy) will come back later in life after the seizures associated with BFNS have gone away. The age that epilepsy begins is variable.","type":"Disease","xrefs":["{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"PS121200\",\"type\":\"Phenotypic series\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"1949\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"1949\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"benign-familial-neonatal-seizures\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}"],"name":"Benign familial neonatal seizures","symbol":"BFNS","alternate_symbols":[],"alternate_names":["Autosomal dominant form of benign neonatal seizures","Benign familial neonatal convulsions","Convulsions benign familial neonatal dominant form"],"id":"33311","medgen_id":"CN230162"}

Signs and symptoms may first appear at any age and generally worsen with time, although in some cases they remain mild.In the early stages of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, affected individuals may have an unusual walking gait, such as waddling or walking on the balls of their feet, and may also have difficulty running. They may need to use their arms to press themselves up from a squatting position because of their weak thigh muscles. As the condition progresses, people with limb-girdle muscular dystrophy may eventually require wheelchair assistance.Muscle wasting may cause changes in posture or in the appearance of the shoulder, back, and arm. In particular, weak shoulder muscles tend to make the shoulder blades (scapulae) \"stick out\" from the back, a sign known as scapular winging. Affected individuals may also have an abnormally curved lower back (lordosis) or a spine that curves to the side (scoliosis). Some develop joint stiffness (contractures) that can restrict movement in their hips, knees, ankles, or elbows. Overgrowth (hypertrophy) of the calf muscles occurs in some people with limb-girdle muscular dystrophy.Weakening of the heart muscle (cardiomyopathy) occurs in some forms of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy.

{"keywords":[],"attribute_content":[],"public_definition":"Primary ciliary dyskinesia is a disorder characterized by chronic respiratory tract infections, abnormally positioned internal organs, and the inability to have children (infertility). The signs and symptoms of this condition are caused by abnormal cilia and flagella. Cilia are microscopic, finger-like projections that stick out from the surface of cells. They are found in the linings of the airway, the reproductive system, and other organs and tissues. Flagella are tail-like structures, similar to cilia, that propel sperm cells forward.In the respiratory tract, cilia move back and forth in a coordinated way to move mucus towards the throat. This movement of mucus helps to eliminate fluid, bacteria, and particles from the lungs. Most babies with primary ciliary dyskinesia experience breathing problems at birth, which suggests that cilia play an important role in clearing fetal fluid from the lungs. Beginning in early childhood, affected individuals develop frequent respiratory tract infections. Without properly functioning cilia in the airway, bacteria remain in the respiratory tract and cause infection. People with primary ciliary dyskinesia also have year-round nasal congestion and a chronic cough. Chronic respiratory tract infections can result in a condition called bronchiectasis, which damages the passages, called bronchi, leading from the windpipe to the lungs and can cause life-threatening breathing problems.Some individuals with primary ciliary dyskinesia have abnormally placed organs within their chest and abdomen. These abnormalities arise early in embryonic development when the differences between the left and right sides of the body are established. About 50 percent of people with primary ciliary dyskinesia have a mirror-image reversal of their internal organs (situs inversus totalis). For example, in these individuals the heart is on the right side of the body instead of on the left. Situs inversus totalis does not cause any apparent health problems. When someone with primary ciliary dyskinesia has situs inversus totalis, they are often said to have Kartagener syndrome.Approximately 12 percent of people with primary ciliary dyskinesia have a condition known as heterotaxy syndrome or situs ambiguus, which is characterized by abnormalities of the heart, liver, intestines, or spleen. These organs may be structurally abnormal or improperly positioned. In addition, affected individuals may lack a spleen (asplenia) or have multiple spleens (polysplenia). Heterotaxy syndrome results from problems establishing the left and right sides of the body during embryonic development. The severity of heterotaxy varies widely among affected individuals.Primary ciliary dyskinesia can also lead to infertility. Vigorous movements of the flagella are necessary to propel the sperm cells forward to the female egg cell. Because their sperm do not move properly, males with primary ciliary dyskinesia are usually unable to father children. Infertility occurs in some affected females and is likely due to abnormal cilia in the fallopian tubes.Another feature of primary ciliary dyskinesia is recurrent ear infections (otitis media), especially in young children. Otitis media can lead to permanent hearing loss if untreated. The ear infections are likely related to abnormal cilia within the inner ear.Rarely, individuals with primary ciliary dyskinesia have an accumulation of fluid in the brain (hydrocephalus), likely due to abnormal cilia in the brain.","type":"Disease","xrefs":["{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"613193\",\"type\":\"MIM\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"244\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"613193\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"CILIARY DYSKINESIA, PRIMARY, 13, WITH OR WITHOUT SITUS INVERSUS\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Alliance\",\"id\":\"Ciliary+dyskinesia%2C+primary%2C+13/7983\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"primary-ciliary-dyskinesia\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"613193\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"symbol\"}"],"name":"Ciliary dyskinesia, primary, 13","symbol":"CILD13","alternate_symbols":[],"alternate_names":["CILIARY DYSKINESIA, PRIMARY, 13, WITH OR WITHOUT SITUS INVERSUS"],"id":"6713","medgen_id":"C2750790","content":"{\"Citation\":{\"@Abbrev\":\"GeneReviews\",\"@Type\":\"review\",\"ID\":[{\"$\":\"20301301\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"},{\"$\":\"NBK1122\",\"@Source\":\"BookShelf\"}]}}"}

{"keywords":[],"attribute_content":[],"public_definition":"Primary coenzyme Q10 deficiency is a disorder that can affect many parts of the body, especially the brain, muscles, and kidneys. As its name suggests, the disorder involves a shortage (deficiency) of a substance called coenzyme Q10.The severity, combination of signs and symptoms, and age of onset of primary coenzyme Q10 deficiency vary widely. In the most severe cases, the condition becomes apparent in infancy and causes severe brain dysfunction combined with muscle weakness (encephalomyopathy) and the failure of other body systems. These problems can be life-threatening. The mildest cases of primary coenzyme Q10 deficiency can begin as late as a person's sixties and often cause cerebellar ataxia, which refers to problems with coordination and balance due to defects in the part of the brain that is involved in coordinating movement (cerebellum). Other neurological abnormalities that can occur in primary coenzyme Q10 deficiency include seizures, intellectual disability, poor muscle tone (hypotonia), involuntary muscle contractions (dystonia), progressive muscle stiffness (spasticity), abnormal eye movements (nystagmus), vision loss caused by degeneration (atrophy) of the optic nerves or breakdown of the light-sensing tissue at the back of the eyes (retinopathy), and sensorineural hearing loss (which is caused by abnormalities in the inner ear). The neurological problems gradually get worse unless treated with coenzyme Q10 supplementation.A type of kidney dysfunction called nephrotic syndrome is another common feature of primary coenzyme Q10 deficiency. It can occur with or without neurological abnormalities. Nephrotic syndrome occurs when damage to the kidneys impairs their function, which allows protein from the blood to pass into the urine (proteinuria). Other signs and symptoms of nephrotic syndrome include increased cholesterol in the blood (hypercholesterolemia), an abnormal buildup of fluid in the abdominal cavity (ascites), and swelling (edema). Affected individuals may also have blood in the urine (hematuria), which can lead to a reduced number of red blood cells in the body (anemia), abnormal blood clotting, or reduced amounts of certain white blood cells. Low white blood cell counts can lead to a weakened immune system and frequent infections in people with nephrotic syndrome. If not treated with coenzyme Q10 supplementation, affected individuals eventually develop irreversible kidney failure (end-stage renal disease).A type of heart disease that enlarges and weakens the heart muscle (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy) can also occur in primary coenzyme Q10 deficiency.","type":"Disease","xrefs":["{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"PS607426\",\"type\":\"Phenotypic series\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"35656\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Alliance\",\"id\":\"Coenzyme+Q10+Deficiency/1707\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"Coenzyme Q10 deficiency\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"primary-coenzyme-q10-deficiency\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}"],"name":"Coenzyme Q10 deficiency, primary","alternate_symbols":[],"alternate_names":["Coenzyme Q10 deficiency"],"id":"33110","medgen_id":"CN229570"}

Phosphate is a mineral that is essential for the normal formation of bones and teeth.In most cases, the signs and symptoms of hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets begin in early childhood. The features of the disorder vary widely, even among affected members of the same family. Mildly affected individuals may have hypophosphatemia without other signs and symptoms. More severely affected children experience slow growth and are shorter than their peers. They develop bone abnormalities that can interfere with movement and cause bone pain. The most noticeable of these abnormalities are bowed legs or knock knees. These abnormalities become apparent with weight-bearing activities such as walking. If untreated, they tend to worsen with time.Other signs and symptoms of hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets can include premature fusion of the skull bones (craniosynostosis) and dental abnormalities. The disorder may also cause abnormal bone growth where ligaments and tendons attach to joints (enthesopathy). In adults, hypophosphatemia is characterized by a softening of the bones known as osteomalacia.Researchers have described several forms of hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets, which are distinguished by their pattern of inheritance and genetic cause. The most common form of the disorder is known as X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets (XLH). It has an X-linked dominant pattern of inheritance.

However, individuals with no symptoms were also reported. In a large series of affected individuals detected on metabolic evaluation for developmental delay, 20% had failure to thrive, feeding difficulties, and hypotonia; 22% had seizures; and 30% had hypotonia without seizures. In contrast, the majority of infants with SCADD have been detected by expanded newborn screening, and the great majority of these infants remain asymptomatic. As with other fatty acid oxidation deficiencies, characteristic biochemical findings of SCADD may be absent except during times of physiologic stress such as fasting and illness.

{"keywords":[],"attribute_content":[],"public_definition":"Breast cancer is a disease in which certain cells in the breast become abnormal and multiply uncontrollably to form a tumor. Although breast cancer is much more common in women, this form of cancer can also develop in men. In both women and men, the most common form of breast cancer begins in cells lining the milk ducts (ductal cancer). In women, cancer can also develop in the glands that produce milk (lobular cancer). Most men have little or no lobular tissue, so lobular cancer in men is very rare.In its early stages, breast cancer usually does not cause pain and may exhibit no noticeable symptoms. As the cancer progresses, signs and symptoms can include a lump or thickening in or near the breast; a change in the size or shape of the breast; nipple discharge, tenderness, or retraction (turning inward); and skin irritation, dimpling, or scaliness. However, these changes can occur as part of many different conditions. Having one or more of these symptoms does not mean that a person definitely has breast cancer.In some cases, cancerous tumors can invade surrounding tissue and spread to other parts of the body. If breast cancer spreads, cancerous cells most often appear in the bones, liver, lungs, or brain. Tumors that begin at one site and then spread to other areas of the body are called metastatic cancers.A small percentage of all breast cancers cluster in families. These cancers are described as hereditary and are associated with inherited gene mutations. Hereditary breast cancers tend to develop earlier in life than noninherited (sporadic) cases, and new (primary) tumors are more likely to develop in both breasts.","disease_mechanism":"gain of function","type":"Disease","xrefs":["{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000021468\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000210160\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000325401\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000325409\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000326160\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000508956\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000509980\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000509982\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000509983\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000509984\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000509985\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000512528\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000512529\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000512644\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000512645\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000512816\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000520071\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000520394\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000522159\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000522160\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000522161\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000525134\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000552183\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000552245\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000558503\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"breast-cancer\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}"],"name":"Breast cancer, susceptibility to","alternate_symbols":[],"disease_mechanism_id":"274","alternate_names":[],"id":"9673","medgen_id":"C3469522","content":"{\"Citation\":{\"@Abbrev\":\"NSGC, 2013\",\"@Type\":\"practice guideline\",\"ID\":{\"$\":\"23188549\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"}}}"}
{"keywords":[],"attribute_content":[],"public_definition":"Calpainopathy is characterized by symmetric and progressive weakness of proximal limb-girdle muscles. The age at onset of muscle weakness ranges from two to 40 years. The phenotype shows intra- and interfamilial variability ranging from severe to mild. Three autosomal recessive calpainopathy phenotypes have been identified based on the distribution of muscle weakness and age at onset: Pelvifemoral limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) (Leyden-Möbius LGMD) phenotype, the most frequently observed calpainopathy phenotype, in which muscle weakness is first evident in the pelvic girdle and later in the shoulder girdle, with onset that may occur as early as before age 12 years or as late as after age 30 years. Scapulohumeral LGMD (Erb LGMD) phenotype, usually a milder phenotype with infrequent early onset, in which muscle weakness is first evident in the shoulder girdle and later in the pelvic girdle. HyperCKemia, usually observed in children or young individuals, in which individuals are asymptomatic and have high serum creatine kinase (CK) concentrations. The autosomal dominant form of calpainopathy shows a variability of clinical phenotype, ranging from almost asymptomatic to wheelchair dependence after age 60 years in few cases with a generally milder phenotype than the recessive form. Clinical findings of calpainopathy include the tendency to walk on tiptoe, difficulty in running, scapular winging, waddling gait, and slight hyperlordosis. Other findings include symmetric weakness of proximal more than distal muscles in the limbs, trunk, and periscapular area; laxity of the abdominal muscles; Achilles tendon shortening; scoliosis; and joint contractures.

{"keywords":[],"attribute_content":[],"public_definition":"X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD) affects the nervous system white matter and the adrenal cortex. Three main phenotypes are seen in affected males: The childhood cerebral form manifests most commonly between ages four and eight years. It initially resembles attention-deficit disorder or hyperactivity; progressive impairment of cognition, behavior, vision, hearing, and motor function follow the initial symptoms and often lead to total disability within six months to two years. Most individuals have impaired adrenocortical function at the time that neurologic disturbances are first noted. Adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN) manifests most commonly in an individual in his twenties or middle age as progressive stiffness and weakness of the legs, sphincter disturbances, sexual dysfunction, and often, impaired adrenocortical function; all symptoms are progressive over decades. \"Addison disease only\" presents with primary adrenocortical insufficiency between age two years and adulthood and most commonly by age 7.5 years, without evidence of neurologic abnormality; however, some degree of neurologic disability (most commonly AMN) usually develops by middle age. More than 20% of female carriers develop mild-to-moderate spastic paraparesis in middle age or later. Adrenal function is usually normal.","disease_mechanism":"loss of function","type":"Disease","xrefs":["{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"300100\",\"type\":\"MIM\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"43\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"300100\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"ADDISON DISEASE AND CEREBRAL SCLEROSIS\"}","{\"db\":\"Office of Rare Diseases\",\"id\":\"10614\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"Adrenomyeloneuropathy\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"300100\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"BRONZE SCHILDER DISEASE\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"300100\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"MELANODERMIC LEUKODYSTROPHY\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"300100\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"SIEMERLING-CREUTZFELDT DISEASE\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"300100\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_symbols\",\"ref_field_element\":\"AMN\"}","{\"db\":\"Office of Rare Diseases\",\"id\":\"10614\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_symbols\",\"ref_field_element\":\"AMN\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000500811\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_symbols\",\"ref_field_element\":\"Adrenoleukodystrophy, ID\"}","{\"db\":\"Office of Rare Diseases\",\"id\":\"5758\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_symbols\",\"ref_field_element\":\"X-ALD\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000070507\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000318975\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000330513\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000500811\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000500892\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000503088\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000503092\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000507942\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000508448\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000510916\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000512569\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000519128\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000520051\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000521375\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000522163\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000522267\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000522268\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000530118\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000559496\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000561876\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Alliance\",\"id\":\"Adrenoleukodystrophy/242\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Office of Rare Diseases\",\"id\":\"5758\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"SNOMED CT\",\"id\":\"65389002\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"GeneReviews\",\"id\":\"NBK1315\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"300100\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"symbol\"}","{\"db\":\"Office of Rare Diseases\",\"id\":\"5758\",\"ref_field\":\"symbol\"}"],"name":"Adrenoleukodystrophy","symbol":"ALD","alternate_symbols":["AMN","Adrenoleukodystrophy, ID","X-ALD"],"disease_mechanism_id":"273","alternate_names":["ADDISON DISEASE AND CEREBRAL SCLEROSIS","Adrenomyeloneuropathy","BRONZE SCHILDER DISEASE","MELANODERMIC LEUKODYSTROPHY","SIEMERLING-CREUTZFELDT DISEASE"],"id":"139","medgen_id":"C0162309","content":"{\"Citation\":[{\"@Abbrev\":\"GeneReviews\",\"@Type\":\"review\",\"ID\":[{\"$\":\"20301491\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"},{\"$\":\"NBK1315\",\"@Source\":\"BookShelf\"}]},{\"@Abbrev\":\"EuroGentest, 2011\",\"@Type\":\"Translational/Evidence-based\",\"ID\":{\"$\":\"22071894\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"}}]}"}

{"keywords":[],"attribute_content":[],"public_definition":"APC-associated polyposis conditions include: familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), attenuated FAP, and gastric adenocarcinoma and proximal polyposis of the stomach (GAPPS). FAP is a colon cancer predisposition syndrome in which hundreds to thousands of adenomatous colonic polyps develop, beginning, on average, at age 16 years (range 7-36 years). By age 35 years, 95% of individuals with FAP have polyps; without colectomy, colon cancer is inevitable. The mean age of colon cancer diagnosis in untreated individuals is 39 years (range 34-43 years). Extracolonic manifestations are variably present and include: polyps of the gastric fundus and duodenum, osteomas, dental anomalies, congenital hypertrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium (CHRPE), soft tissue tumors, desmoid tumors, and associated cancers. Attenuated FAP is characterized by multiple colonic polyps (average of 30), more proximally located polyps, and a diagnosis of colon cancer at a later age than in FAP. Certain extracolonic manifestations, such as gastric and duodenal polyps or cancers, are variably present in attenuated FAP; risk management may be substantially different between FAP and attenuated FAP. GAPPS is characterized by gastric fundic gland polyposis, increased risk of gastric cancer, and limited colonic involvement in most individuals reported.","disease_mechanism":"loss of

{"keywords":[],"attribute_content":[],"public_definition":"Acid sphingomyelinase (ASM) deficiency has been categorized in the past as either neuronopathic (Niemann-Pick disease type A [NPD-A]), with death in early childhood, or non-neuronopathic (Niemann-Pick disease type B [NPD-B]). While forms intermediate to these two extremes occur, all ASM deficiency that is not NPD-A is designated in this review as NPD-B, despite its wide range of manifestations and severity. The first symptom in NPD-A is hepatosplenomegaly, usually noted by age three months; over time the liver and spleen become massive. Psychomotor development progresses no further than the 12-month level, after which neurologic deterioration is relentless. A classic cherry-red spot of the macula of the retina, which may not be present in the first few months, is eventually present in all affected children. Interstitial lung disease caused by storage of sphingomyelin in pulmonary macrophages results in frequent respiratory infections and often respiratory failure. Most children succumb before the third year. NPD type B, later in onset and milder in manifestations than NPD type A, is characterized by hepatosplenomegaly with progressive hypersplenism and stable liver dysfunction, gradual deterioration in pulmonary function, osteopenia, and atherogenic lipid profile. Progressive and/or clinically significant neurologic manifestations occur infrequently. Survival to adulthood can occur.","disease_mechanism":"loss of function","type":"Disease","xrefs":["{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"607616\",\"type\":\"MIM\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"77293\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000051492\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000246735\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000330870\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000501745\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000501749\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000522527\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000528634\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000556495\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000556506\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000556507\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000556508\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000556520\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000558532\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Alliance\",\"id\":\"Niemann-Pick+Disease%2C+Type+B/5227\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"SNOMED CT\",\"id\":\"39390005\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"GeneReviews\",\"id\":\"NBK1370\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}"],"name":"Niemann-Pick disease, type B","alternate_symbols":[],"disease_mechanism_id":"273","alternate_names":[],"id":"3636","medgen_id":"C0268243","content":"{\"Citation\":{\"@Abbrev\":\"GeneReviews\",\"@Type\":\"review\",\"ID\":[{\"$\":\"20301544\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"},{\"$\":\"NBK1370\",\"@Source\":\"BookShelf\"}]}}"}
{"keywords":[],"attribute_content":[],"public_definition":"Hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets is a disorder related to low levels of phosphate in the blood (hypophosphatemia). Phosphate is a mineral that is essential for the normal formation of bones and teeth.In most cases, the signs and symptoms of hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets begin in early childhood. The features of the disorder vary widely, even among affected members of the same family. Mildly affected individuals may have hypophosphatemia without other signs and symptoms. More severely affected children experience slow growth and are shorter than their peers. They develop bone abnormalities that can interfere with movement and cause bone pain. The most noticeable of these abnormalities are bowed legs or knock knees. These abnormalities become apparent with weight-bearing activities such as walking. If untreated, they tend to worsen with time.Other signs and symptoms of hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets can include premature fusion of the skull bones (craniosynostosis) and dental abnormalities. The disorder may also cause abnormal bone growth where ligaments and tendons attach to joints (enthesopathy). In adults, hypophosphatemia is characterized by a softening of the bones known as osteomalacia.Researchers have described several forms of hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets, which are distinguished by their pattern of inheritance and genetic cause. The most common form of the disorder is known as X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets (XLH). It has an X-linked dominant pattern of inheritance. X-linked recessive, autosomal dominant, and autosomal recessive forms of the disorder are much rarer.Another rare type of the disorder is known as hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets with hypercalciuria (HHRH). In addition to hypophosphatemia, this condition is characterized by the excretion of high levels of calcium in the urine (hypercalciuria).","disease_mechanism":"loss of function","type":"Disease","xrefs":["{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"241520\",\"type\":\"MIM\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"289176\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"241520\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"HYPOPHOSPHATEMIA, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"241520\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_symbols\",\"ref_field_element\":\"ARHP\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"241520\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_symbols\",\"ref_field_element\":\"ARHR\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000332443\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000509761\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000511515\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000561987\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Alliance\",\"id\":\"Autosomal+recessive+hypophosphatemic+vitamin+D+refractory+rickets/7794\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"SNOMED CT\",\"id\":\"90505000\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"hereditary-hypophosphatemic-rickets\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"241520\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"symbol\"}"],"name":"Autosomal recessive hypophosphatemic vitamin D refractory rickets","symbol":"ARHR1","alternate_symbols":["ARHP","ARHR"],"disease_mechanism_id":"273","alternate_names":["HYPOPHOSPHATEMIA, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE"],"id":"1762","medgen_id":"C4551495"}

{"keywords":[],"attribute_content":[],"public_definition":"Early infantile epileptic encephalopathy 1 (EIEE1) is a seizure disorder characterized by a type of seizure known as infantile spasms. The spasms usually appear before the age of 1. Several types of spasms have been described, but the most commonly reported type involves bending at the waist and neck and extending the arms and legs (sometimes called a jackknife spasm). Each spasm lasts only seconds, but they occur in clusters several minutes long. Although individuals do not usually have spasms while they are sleeping, the spasms commonly occur just after awakening. Infantile spasms usually stop by age 5, but many children then develop other types of seizures that recur throughout their lives.Most babies with EIEE1 have characteristic results on an electroencephalogram (EEG), a test used to measure the electrical activity of the brain. The EEG of these individuals typically shows an irregular pattern known as hypsarrhythmia, and this finding can help differentiate infantile spasms from other types of seizures.Because of the recurrent seizures, babies with EIEE1 stop developing normally and begin to lose skills they have acquired (developmental regression), such as sitting, rolling over, and babbling.

Neurologic manifestations include hypotonia, spasticity, movement disorders (including chorea), cerebellar ataxia, and peripheral neuropathy. Extraneurologic manifestations may include hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, hypertrichosis, anemia, renal tubulopathy, liver involvement, ptosis, and muscle weakness. Onset is typically between ages three and 12 months; about 50% of affected individuals die by age three years, most often as a result of respiratory or cardiac failure.

Renal cell carcinoma occurs in about 70% of individuals with VHL and is the leading cause of mortality. Pheochromocytomas can be asymptomatic but may cause sustained or episodic hypertension. Pancreatic lesions often remain asymptomatic and rarely cause endocrine or exocrine insufficiency. Endolymphatic sac tumors can cause hearing loss of varying severity, which can be a presenting symptom. Cystadenomas of the epididymis are relatively common.

The clinical features of COL1A1/2-OI represent a continuum ranging from perinatal lethality to individuals with severe skeletal deformities, mobility impairments, and very short stature to nearly asymptomatic individuals with a mild predisposition to fractures, normal dentition, normal stature, and normal life span. Fractures can occur in any bone but are most common in the extremities. DI is characterized by gray or brown teeth that may appear translucent, wear down, and break easily. COL1A1/2-OI has been classified into four types based on clinical presentation and radiographic findings. This classification system can be helpful in providing information about prognosis and management for a given individual. The four more common OI types are now referred to as follows: Classic non-deforming OI with blue sclerae (previously OI type I). Perinatally lethal OI (previously OI type II). Progressively deforming OI (previously OI type III).

{"keywords":[],"attribute_content":[],"public_definition":"FMR1 disorders include fragile X syndrome (FXS), fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS), and fragile X-associated primary ovarian insufficiency (FXPOI). Fragile X syndrome occurs in individuals with an FMR1 full mutation or other loss-of-function variant and is nearly always characterized in affected males by developmental delay and intellectual disability along with a variety of behavioral issues. Autism spectrum disorder is present in 50%-70% of individuals with FXS. Affected males may have characteristic craniofacial features (which become more obvious with age) and medical problems including hypotonia, gastroesophageal reflux, strabismus, seizures, sleep disorders, joint laxity, pes planus, scoliosis, and recurrent otitis media. Adults may have mitral valve prolapse or aortic root dilatation. The physical and behavioral features seen in males with FXS have been reported in females heterozygous for the FMR1 full mutation, but with lower frequency and milder involvement. FXTAS occurs in individuals who have an FMR1 premutation and is characterized by late-onset, progressive cerebellar ataxia and intention tremor followed by cognitive impairment. Psychiatric disorders are common. Age of onset is typically between 60 and 65 years and is more common among males who are hemizygous for the premutation (40%) than among females who are heterozygous for the premutation (16%-20%). FXPOI, defined as hypergonadotropic hypogonadism before age 40 years, has been observed in 20% of women who carry a premutation allele compared to 1% in the general population.","disease_mechanism":"loss of function","type":"Disease","xrefs":["{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"300624\",\"type\":\"MIM\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"449291\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"908\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"300624\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"FRAGILE X MENTAL RETARDATION SYNDROME\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"300624\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"MENTAL RETARDATION, X-LINKED, ASSOCIATED WITH marXq28\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000264966\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000552393\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000553203\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000556541\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000558914\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000560955\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000561923\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000568029\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000568236\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000568277\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000569426\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Alliance\",\"id\":\"Fragile+X+Syndrome/2906\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Office of Rare Diseases\",\"id\":\"6464\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"SNOMED CT\",\"id\":\"613003\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"GeneReviews\",\"id\":\"NBK1384\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"300624\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"symbol\"}","{\"db\":\"Office of Rare Diseases\",\"id\":\"6464\",\"ref_field\":\"symbol\"}"],"name":"Fragile X syndrome","symbol":"FXS","alternate_symbols":[],"disease_mechanism_id":"273","alternate_names":["FRAGILE X MENTAL RETARDATION SYNDROME","Fragile X syndrome, type A","MENTAL RETARDATION, X-LINKED, ASSOCIATED WITH marXq28"],"id":"1302","medgen_id":"C0016667","content":"{\"Citation\":[{\"@Type\":\"practice guideline\",\"ID\":{\"$\":\"22797890\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"}},{\"@Abbrev\":\"GeneReviews\",\"@Type\":\"review\",\"ID\":[{\"$\":\"20301558\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"},{\"$\":\"NBK1384\",\"@Source\":\"BookShelf\"}]},{\"@Abbrev\":\"ACMG, 2001\",\"@Type\":\"practice guideline\",\"ID\":{\"$\":\"3110344\",\"@Source\":\"pmc\"}},{\"@Abbrev\":\"ACMG, 2008\",\"@Type\":\"practice guideline\",\"ID\":{\"$\":\"3111012\",\"@Source\":\"pmc\"}},{\"@Abbrev\":\"ACMG, 2005\",\"@Type\":\"practice guideline\",\"ID\":{\"$\":\"3110946\",\"@Source\":\"pmc\"}},{\"@Abbrev\":\"ACMG, 2008\",\"@Type\":\"practice guideline\",\"ID\":{\"$\":\"3111547\",\"@Source\":\"pmc\"}},{\"@Abbrev\":\"EuroGenetest, 2011\",\"@Type\":\"Translational/Evidence-based\",\"ID\":{\"$\":\"21540884\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"}},{\"@Abbrev\":\"ACMG, 2013\",\"@Type\":\"practice guideline\",\"ID\":{\"$\":\"23519317\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"}},{\"@Abbrev\":\"EMQN, 2015\",\"@Type\":\"practice guideline\",\"ID\":{\"$\":\"25227148\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"}},{\"@Abbrev\":\"ACMG, 2013\",\"@Type\":\"practice guideline\",\"ID\":{\"$\":\"23765048\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"}}]}"}

{"keywords":[],"attribute_content":[],"public_definition":"Congenital hyperinsulinism is a condition that causes individuals to have abnormally high levels of insulin, which is a hormone that helps control blood sugar levels. People with this condition have frequent episodes of low blood sugar (hypoglycemia). In infants and young children, these episodes are characterized by a lack of energy (lethargy), irritability, or difficulty feeding. Repeated episodes of low blood sugar increase the risk for serious complications such as breathing difficulties, seizures, intellectual disability, vision loss, brain damage, and coma.The severity of congenital hyperinsulinism varies widely among affected individuals, even among members of the same family. About 60 percent of infants with this condition experience a hypoglycemic episode within the first month of life. Other affected children develop hypoglycemia by early childhood. Unlike typical episodes of hypoglycemia, which occur most often after periods without food (fasting) or after exercising, episodes of hypoglycemia in people with congenital hyperinsulinism can also occur after eating.","disease_mechanism":"loss of function","type":"Disease","xrefs":["{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"601820\",\"type\":\"MIM\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"276580\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"276603\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"601820\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"HYPERINSULINEMIC HYPOGLYCEMIA DUE TO FOCAL ADENOMATOUS HYPERPLASIA\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"601820\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"HYPERINSULINEMIC HYPOGLYCEMIA, PERSISTENT\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"601820\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"HYPERINSULINISM, CONGENITAL\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"601820\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"HYPERINSULINISM, FAMILIAL\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"601820\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"HYPERINSULINISM, NEONATAL\"}","{\"db\":\"Office of Rare Diseases\",\"id\":\"9927\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"Hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia familial 2\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"601820\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"PERSISTENT HYPERINSULINEMIC HYPOGLYCEMIA OF INFANCY\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"601820\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_symbols\",\"ref_field_element\":\"PHHI\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000241589\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000260573\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000284792\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000284796\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000500516\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000506422\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000507676\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000530438\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000530439\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000552542\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000552549\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000556820\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000559250\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Alliance\",\"id\":\"Islet+cell+hyperplasia/8684\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"SNOMED CT\",\"id\":\"42681006\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"congenital-hyperinsulinism\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"601820\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"symbol\"}","{\"db\":\"Office of Rare Diseases\",\"id\":\"9927\",\"ref_field\":\"symbol\"}"],"name":"Islet cell hyperplasia","symbol":"HHF2","alternate_symbols":["PHHI"],"disease_mechanism_id":"273","alternate_names":["HYPERINSULINEMIC HYPOGLYCEMIA DUE TO FOCAL ADENOMATOUS HYPERPLASIA","HYPERINSULINEMIC HYPOGLYCEMIA, PERSISTENT","HYPERINSULINISM, CONGENITAL","HYPERINSULINISM, FAMILIAL","HYPERINSULINISM, NEONATAL","Hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia familial 2","Nesidioblastosis","PERSISTENT HYPERINSULINEMIC HYPOGLYCEMIA OF INFANCY"],"id":"2358","medgen_id":"C2931833","content":"{\"Citation\":{\"@Abbrev\":\"GeneReviews\",\"@Type\":\"review\",\"ID\":[{\"$\":\"20301549\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"},{\"$\":\"NBK1375\",\"@Source\":\"BookShelf\"}]}}"}

A broad range of clinical features both within and across families is observed. The age of onset ranges from 35 to 87 years. Behavioral disturbances are the most common early feature, followed by progressive aphasia. Impairment in executive function manifests as loss of judgment and insight. In early stages, PPA often manifests as deficits in naming, word finding, or word comprehension. In late stages, affected individuals often become mute and lose their ability to communicate. Early findings of parkinsonism include rigidity, bradykinesia or akinesia (slowing or absence of movements), limb dystonia, apraxia (loss of ability to carry out learned purposeful movements), and disequilibrium. Late motor findings may include myoclonus, dysarthria, and dysphagia. Most affected individuals eventually lose the ability to walk. Disease duration is three to 12 years.","disease_mechanism":"loss of

{"keywords":[],"attribute_content":[],"public_definition":"Acid sphingomyelinase (ASM) deficiency has been categorized in the past as either neuronopathic (Niemann-Pick disease type A [NPD-A]), with death in early childhood, or non-neuronopathic (Niemann-Pick disease type B [NPD-B]). While forms intermediate to these two extremes occur, all ASM deficiency that is not NPD-A is designated in this review as NPD-B, despite its wide range of manifestations and severity. The first symptom in NPD-A is hepatosplenomegaly, usually noted by age three months; over time the liver and spleen become massive. Psychomotor development progresses no further than the 12-month level, after which neurologic deterioration is relentless. A classic cherry-red spot of the macula of the retina, which may not be present in the first few months, is eventually present in all affected children. Interstitial lung disease caused by storage of sphingomyelin in pulmonary macrophages results in frequent respiratory infections and often respiratory failure. Most children succumb before the third year. NPD type B, later in onset and milder in manifestations than NPD type A, is characterized by hepatosplenomegaly with progressive hypersplenism and stable liver dysfunction, gradual deterioration in pulmonary function, osteopenia, and atherogenic lipid profile. Progressive and/or clinically significant neurologic manifestations occur infrequently. Survival to adulthood can occur.","disease_mechanism":"loss of function","type":"Disease","xrefs":["{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"257200\",\"type\":\"MIM\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"77292\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"257200\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"SPHINGOMYELIN LIPIDOSIS\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"257200\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"SPHINGOMYELINASE DEFICIENCY\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000051492\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000246735\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000330870\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000501745\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000501749\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000506506\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000507864\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000522527\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000528634\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000551442\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000556495\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000556506\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000556507\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000556508\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000556520\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000558532\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000569406\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000569442\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Alliance\",\"id\":\"Niemann-Pick+Disease%2C+Type+A/5226\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"SNOMED CT\",\"id\":\"52165006\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"GeneReviews\",\"id\":\"NBK1370\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}"],"name":"Niemann-Pick disease, type A","alternate_symbols":[],"disease_mechanism_id":"273","alternate_names":["SPHINGOMYELIN LIPIDOSIS","SPHINGOMYELINASE DEFICIENCY"],"id":"5650","medgen_id":"C0268242","content":"{\"Citation\":[{\"@Abbrev\":\"GeneReviews\",\"@Type\":\"review\",\"ID\":[{\"$\":\"20301544\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"},{\"$\":\"NBK1370\",\"@Source\":\"BookShelf\"}]},{\"@Abbrev\":\"ACMG, 2008\",\"@Type\":\"practice guideline\",\"ID\":{\"$\":\"18197057\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"}},{\"@Abbrev\":\"ACOG, 2009\",\"@Type\":\"practice guideline\",\"ID\":{\"$\":\"19888064\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"}}]}"}

{"keywords":[],"attribute_content":[],"public_definition":"Primary hyperoxaluria type 1 (PH1) is caused by a deficiency of the liver peroxisomal enzyme alanine:glyoxylate-aminotransferase (AGT), which catalyzes the conversion of glyoxylate to glycine. When AGT activity is absent, glyoxylate is converted to oxalate, which forms insoluble calcium oxalate crystals that accumulate in the kidney and other organs. Individuals with PH1 are at risk for recurrent nephrolithiasis (deposition of calcium oxalate in the renal pelvis / urinary tract), nephrocalcinosis (deposition of calcium oxalate in the renal parenchyma), or end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Age at onset of symptoms ranges from infancy to the sixth decade. Approximately 10% of affected individuals present in infancy or early childhood with nephrocalcinosis, with or without nephrolithiasis, and failure to thrive related to renal failure.

AIP is considered \"overt\" in a heterozygote who was previously or is currently symptomatic; AIP is considered \"latent\" in a heterozygote who has never had symptoms, and typically has been identified during molecular genetic testing of at-risk family members. Note that GeneReviews does not use the term \"carrier\" for an individual who is heterozygous for an autosomal dominant pathogenic variant; GeneReviews reserves the term \"carrier\" for an individual who is heterozygous for an autosomal recessive disorder and thus is not expected to ever develop manifestations of the disorder. Overt AIP is characterized clinically by life-threatening acute neurovisceral attacks of severe abdominal pain without peritoneal signs, often accompanied by nausea, vomiting, tachycardia, and hypertension. Attacks may be complicated by neurologic findings (mental changes, convulsions, and peripheral neuropathy that may progress to respiratory paralysis), and hyponatremia. Acute attacks, which may be provoked by certain drugs, alcoholic beverages, endocrine factors, calorie restriction, stress, and infections, usually resolve within two weeks. Most individuals with AIP have one or a few attacks; about 3%-8% (mainly women) have recurrent attacks (defined as \u003e3 attacks/year) that may persist for years. Other long-term complications are chronic renal failure, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and hypertension. Attacks, which are very rare before puberty, are more common in women than men. Latent AIP.

Squamous cells are found in the outer layer of skin and in the mucous membranes, which are the moist tissues that line body cavities such as the airways and intestines. Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) develops in the mucous membranes of the mouth, nose, and throat.HNSCC is classified by its location: it can occur in the mouth (oral cavity), the middle part of the throat near the mouth (oropharynx), the space behind the nose (nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses), the upper part of the throat near the nasal cavity (nasopharynx), the voicebox (larynx), or the lower part of the throat near the larynx (hypopharynx). Depending on the location, the cancer can cause abnormal patches or open sores (ulcers) in the mouth and throat, unusual bleeding or pain in the mouth, sinus congestion that does not clear, sore throat, earache, pain when swallowing or difficulty swallowing, a hoarse voice, difficulty breathing, or enlarged lymph nodes.HNSCC can spread (metastasize) to other parts of the body, such as the lymph nodes or lungs. If it spreads, the cancer has a worse prognosis and can be fatal. About half of affected individuals survive more than five years after diagnosis.","type":"Disease","xrefs":["{\"db\":\"MeSH\",\"id\":\"C535575\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"275355\",\"type\":\"MIM\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"494547\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"494550\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"500464\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"500478\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"500481\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"502363\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"502366\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"67037\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Alliance\",\"id\":\"Squamous+cell+carcinoma+of+the+head+and+neck/6853\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Office of Rare Diseases\",\"id\":\"8503\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"head-and-neck-squamous-cell-carcinoma\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"275355\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"symbol\"}","{\"db\":\"Office of Rare Diseases\",\"id\":\"8503\",\"ref_field\":\"symbol\"}"],"name":"Squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck","symbol":"HNSCC","alternate_symbols":["midline carcinoma"],"alternate_names":["Squamous cell carcinoma, head and neck, somatic"],"id":"4210","medgen_id":"C1168401"}

Mononeuropathy that occurs in childhood is an increasingly recognized finding; it frequently presents as a persistent facial palsy or hand/foot drop.","disease_mechanism":"loss of function","type":"Disease","xrefs":["{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"101000\",\"type\":\"MIM\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"637\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"101000\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_symbols\",\"ref_field_element\":\"ACN\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"101000\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_symbols\",\"ref_field_element\":\"BANF\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000324942\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000335543\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000335548\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000500116\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000510681\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000511190\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000514608\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000520069\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000521547\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000522322\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000522559\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000528460\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000528652\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000528909\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000528930\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000551653\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000551659\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000552305\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000552306\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000552308\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000569525\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Alliance\",\"id\":\"Neurofibromatosis+type+2/5175\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"SNOMED CT\",\"id\":\"92503002\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"GeneReviews\",\"id\":\"NBK1201\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"101000\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"symbol\"}"],"name":"Neurofibromatosis, type 2","symbol":"NF2","alternate_symbols":["ACN","BANF"],"disease_mechanism_id":"273","alternate_names":[],"id":"3089","medgen_id":"C0027832","content":"{\"Citation\":[{\"@Abbrev\":\"GeneReviews\",\"@Type\":\"review\",\"ID\":[{\"$\":\"20301380\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"},{\"$\":\"NBK1201\",\"@Source\":\"BookShelf\"}]},{\"@Abbrev\":\"ACMG, 2013\",\"@Type\":\"Recommendation\",\"ID\":{\"$\":\"23788249\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"}},{\"@Abbrev\":\"ACMG, 2015\",\"@Type\":\"Recommendation\",\"ID\":{\"$\":\"25356965\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"}},{\"@Abbrev\":\"ACMG, 2016\",\"@Type\":\"Recommendation\",\"ID\":[{\"$\":\"27854360\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"},{\"$\":\"10.1038/gim.2016.190\",\"@Source\":\"DOI\"}]}]}"}

CS is a multiple hamartoma syndrome with a high risk for benign and malignant tumors of the thyroid, breast, and endometrium. Affected individuals usually have macrocephaly, trichilemmomas, and papillomatous papules, and present by the late 20s. The lifetime risk of developing breast cancer is 85%, with an average age of diagnosis between 38 and 46 years. The lifetime risk for thyroid cancer (usually follicular, rarely papillary, but never medullary thyroid cancer) is approximately 35%. The risk for endometrial cancer may approach 28%. BRRS is a congenital disorder characterized by macrocephaly, intestinal hamartomatous polyposis, lipomas, and pigmented macules of the glans penis. PS is a complex, highly variable disorder involving congenital malformations and hamartomatous overgrowth of multiple tissues, as well as connective tissue nevi, epidermal nevi, and hyperostoses. Proteus-like syndrome is undefined but refers to individuals with significant clinical features of PS who do not meet the diagnostic criteria for PS.","disease_mechanism":"loss of function","type":"Disease","xrefs":["{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"601728\",\"type\":\"MIM\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"306498\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000326160\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000551654\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000552184\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000552245\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000552302\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000552440\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000558503\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000558905\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"GeneReviews\",\"id\":\"NBK1488\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}"],"name":"PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome","symbol":"PHTS","alternate_symbols":[],"disease_mechanism_id":"273","alternate_names":["PTEN Hamartomatous Tumour Syndrome"],"id":"10363","medgen_id":"C1959582","content":"{\"Citation\":[{\"@Abbrev\":\"GeneReviews\",\"@Type\":\"review\",\"ID\":[{\"$\":\"20301661\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"},{\"$\":\"NBK1488\",\"@Source\":\"BookShelf\"}]},{\"@Abbrev\":\"ACS, 2007\",\"@Type\":\"practice guideline\",\"ID\":{\"$\":\"17392385\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"}},{\"@Abbrev\":\"ACMG, 2013\",\"@Type\":\"Recommendation\",\"ID\":{\"$\":\"23788249\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"}},{\"@Abbrev\":\"ACMG, 2013\",\"@Type\":\"practice guideline\",\"ID\":{\"$\":\"23519317\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"}},{\"@Abbrev\":\"NCCN, 2014\",\"@Type\":\"practice guideline\",\"ID\":{\"$\":\"25190698\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"}},{\"@Abbrev\":\"ACG, 2015\",\"@Type\":\"practice guideline\",\"ID\":{\"$\":\"25645574\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"}},{\"@Abbrev\":\"ACMG, 2015\",\"@Type\":\"Recommendation\",\"ID\":{\"$\":\"25356965\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"}},{\"@Abbrev\":\"ACMG, 2016\",\"@Type\":\"Recommendation\",\"ID\":[{\"$\":\"27854360\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"},{\"$\":\"10.1038/gim.2016.190\",\"@Source\":\"DOI\"}]}]}"}

{"keywords":["hereditary cancer syndrome"],"attribute_content":[],"public_definition":"Familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (FHL) is characterized by proliferation and infiltration of hyperactivated macrophages and T-lymphocytes manifesting as acute illness with prolonged fever, cytopenias, and hepatosplenomegaly. Onset is typically within the first months or years of life and, on occasion, in utero, although later childhood or adult onset is more common than previously suspected. Neurologic abnormalities may be present initially or may develop later; they may include increased intracranial pressure, irritability, neck stiffness, hypotonia, hypertonia, convulsions, cranial nerve palsies, ataxia, hemiplegia, quadriplegia, blindness, and coma. Rash and lymphadenopathy are less common. Other findings include liver dysfunction and bone marrow hemophagocytosis. The median survival of children with typical FHL, without treatment, is less than two months; progression of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and infection account for the majority of deaths in untreated individuals.","type":"Disease","xrefs":["{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"PS267700\",\"type\":\"Phenotypic series\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"540\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Alliance\",\"id\":\"Hemophagocytic+Lymphohistiocytosis+%28HLH%29/3306\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis\"}","{\"db\":\"Office of Rare Diseases\",\"id\":\"6589\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"SNOMED CT\",\"id\":\"398250003\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"GeneReviews\",\"id\":\"NBK1444\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}"],"name":"Familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis","symbol":"FHL","alternate_symbols":["HPLH"],"alternate_names":["Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis"],"id":"14293","medgen_id":"C0272199","content":"{\"Citation\":{\"@Abbrev\":\"GeneReviews\",\"@Type\":\"review\",\"ID\":[{\"$\":\"20301617\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"},{\"$\":\"NBK1444\",\"@Source\":\"BookShelf\"}]}}"}
