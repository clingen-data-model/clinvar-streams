Poloschek et al. (2010) reported that V2050L heterozygous carriers show centrally reduced mfERG amplitudes and additional minor fundus abnormalities, which suggested that the V2050L variant in the heterozygous state is capable of mildly reducing macular function without an additional pathogenic variant on the second allele. However, the V2050L variant is observed in 202/34420 (0.5869%) alleles from individuals of Latino background and 787/277174 (0.2839%) global alleles, with one homozygote reported (Lek et al., 2016). The V2050L variant is a conservative amino acid substitution, which occurs at a position that is conserved across species. In-silico analyses, including protein predictors and evolutionary conservation, support that this variant does not alter protein structure/function. We interpret V2050L as a variant of uncertain significance.\"}"],"interpretation_date_last_evaluated":"2018-11-07","variation_id":"7884","id":"SCV000511911","clinical_assertion_trait_set_id":"SCV000511911","submission_names":["SUB5098196"],"variation_archive_id":"VCV000007884","content":"{\"AttributeSet\":{\"Attribute\":{\"$\":\"GeneDx Variant Classification (06012015)\",\"@Type\":\"AssertionMethod\"},\"Citation\":{\"URL\":{\"$\":\"https://submit.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ft/byid/7oynscmk/mdi-5616_26957_genedx_interprules_final_061215.pdf\"}}}}","clinical_assertion_observation_ids":["SCV000511911.0"],"local_key":"GDX:874|Not Provided","assertion_type":"variation to disease","submitter_id":"26957","interpretation_description":"Uncertain significance","review_status":"criteria provided, single submitter","internal_id":"977225","trait_set_id":"9460","date_last_updated":"2019-12-17","submitted_assembly":"GRCh37"}

Three of five in-silico tools predict a benign effect of the variant on protein function. The variant allele was found at a frequency of 0.002 in 251040 control chromosomes in the gnomAD database (exomes dataset), predominantly found within the Ashkenazi Jewish subpopulation at a frequency of 0.036, including 7 homozygotes. The observed variant frequency within Ashkenazi Jewish control individuals in the gnomAD database is approximately 500 fold of the estimated maximal expected allele frequency for a pathogenic variant in APC causing Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP) phenotype (7.1e-05), strongly suggesting that the variant is a benign polymorphism found primarily in populations of Ashkenazi Jewish origin. The variant, c.3920T\u003eA, has been reported in the literature in multiple individuals affected with colorectal cancer (CRC) and other tumor phenotypes, however in some of these cases it was also reported to co-occur with other pathogenic variants (Yurgelun_2017 and Simbolo_2015). Multiple case-control studies (Abdel-Malak_2016, Drucker_2000, Fidder_2005, Gryfe_1998, Laken_1997, Leshno_2016, and Shtoyerman-Chen_2001), demonstrated that this variant is associated with a moderately increased risk for CRC in Ashkenazi Jewish population. A large meta-analysis concluded that the variant increases the risk about two-fold for CRC in individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry (OR=2.17, 95% CI=1.65-2.86), however it does not appear to confer an additional risk for CRC in non-Ashkenazi cases (Liang_2013). A recent case-control study involving a large Israeli cohort indicated that this variant might be also associated with a significantly higher risk for non-CRC cancers, with the APC I1307K variant being proposed as a reliable marker for overall cancer risk (OR=2.53) (Leshno_2016). The A8 mononucleotide tract created by this germline change has been shown to confer an increased propensity for generating somatic frameshift mutations on this allele, leading to a loss of function of APC that constitutes an important somatic event in tumor initiation (Gryfe_1998; Laken_1997). 19 other submitters have provided clinical-significance assessments for this variant to ClinVar after 2014 without evidence for independent evaluation. Multiple laboratories reported the variant with conflicting assessments, with 7 reporting it as a risk factor. Taken together, this polymorphic variant is associated with a modestly increased risk for CRC in the Ashkenazi Jewish population, but is not associated with FAP or AFAP. Based on the evidence outlined above, the variant was classified as VUS-possibly pathogenic.\"}"],"interpretation_date_last_evaluated":"2019-08-27","variation_id":"822","id":"SCV000694042","clinical_assertion_trait_set_id":"SCV000694042","submission_names":["SUB6341163"],"variation_archive_id":"VCV000000822","content":"{\"AttributeSet\":{\"Attribute\":{\"$\":\"LabCorp Variant Classification Summary - May 2015\",\"@Type\":\"AssertionMethod\"},\"Citation\":{\"URL\":{\"$\":\"https://submit.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ft/byid/pttb9itm/labcorp_variant_classification_method_-_may_2015.pdf\"}}},\"Interpretation\":{\"Citation\":[{\"ID\":{\"$\":\"18343606\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"}},{\"ID\":{\"$\":\"9751605\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"}},{\"ID\":{\"$\":\"9288102\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"}},{\"ID\":{\"$\":\"23576677\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"}},{\"ID\":{\"$\":\"9973276\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"}},{\"ID\":{\"$\":\"26845104\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"}},{\"ID\":{\"$\":\"26300997\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"}},{\"ID\":{\"$\":\"26394139\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"}},{\"ID\":{\"$\":\"26421687\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"}},{\"ID\":{\"$\":\"24416237\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"}},{\"ID\":{\"$\":\"27153395\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"}},{\"ID\":{\"$\":\"27978560\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"}},{\"ID\":{\"$\":\"14633595\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"}},{\"ID\":{\"$\":\"28135145\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"}},{\"ID\":{\"$\":\"28050010\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"}},{\"ID\":{\"$\":\"25604157\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"}},{\"ID\":{\"$\":\"10679643\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"}},{\"ID\":{\"$\":\"15929773\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"}},{\"ID\":{\"$\":\"11207040\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"}},{\"ID\":{\"$\":\"28749474\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"}},{\"ID\":{\"$\":\"30152102\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"}},{\"ID\":{\"$\":\"30426508\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"}},{\"ID\":{\"$\":\"26187149\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"}},{\"ID\":{\"$\":\"29961768\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"}}]}}","clinical_assertion_observation_ids":["SCV000694042.0"],"local_key":"NM_000038.5:c.3920T\u003eA|MedGen:CN169374","assertion_type":"variation to disease","submitter_id":"500026","interpretation_description":"Uncertain significance","review_status":"criteria provided, single submitter","internal_id":"1360394","trait_set_id":"9590","date_last_updated":"2019-11-11","submitted_assembly":"GRCh37"}
