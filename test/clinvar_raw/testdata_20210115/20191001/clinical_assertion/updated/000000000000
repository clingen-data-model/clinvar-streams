This variant is observed in the general population at an overall allele frequency of 30.8% (85329/277132 alleles, including 15447 homozygotes) in the Genome Aggregation Database. This variant has been studied extensively and is considered a ''susceptibility'' or an ''association'' variant. The thermolabile c.665C\u003eT in a homozygous state has been correlated with reduced enzyme activity and increased homocysteine (Frosst 1995). Recent publication of the American College of Medical Genetics stated that this variant, c.665C\u003eT; p.Ala222Val, in the heterozygous form is unlikely to be of clinical significance (Hickey 2013); however, a possible effect of this variant when paired with the pathogenic MTHFR variant, on the opposite chromosome cannot be excluded. Deep intronic variants and variants in the untranslated region are not analyzed by this method; therefore, another pathogenic MTHFR variant cannot be ruled out.\"}"],"submitter_id":"25969","clinical_assertion_trait_set_id":"SCV000884146","review_status":"criteria provided, single submitter","trait_set_id":"9460","interpretation_date_last_evaluated":"2017-05-02","id":"SCV000884146","assertion_type":"variation to disease","record_status":"current","local_key":"74380|Not Provided","internal_id":"1730401","date_created":"2019-02-15","variation_id":"3520","variation_archive_id":"VCV000003520","clinical_assertion_observation_ids":["SCV000884146.0"],"rcv_accession_id":"RCV000153516"}
