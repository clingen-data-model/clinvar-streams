Utilizing variant allele frequency, disease prevalence and penetrance estimates, and inheritance mode, an automated score was calculated to assess if this variant is too frequent to cause the disease. Based on the score, this variant could not be ruled out of causing disease and therefore its association with disease required further investigation. A literature search was performed for the gene, cDNA change, and amino acid change (if applicable). No publications were found based on this search.
