{"alternate_names":[],"type":"Disease","alternate_symbols":["IDDM22"],"symbol":"T1D22","id":"1969","public_definition":"Type 1 diabetes is a disorder characterized by abnormally high blood sugar levels. In this form of diabetes, specialized cells in the pancreas called beta cells stop producing insulin. Insulin controls how much glucose (a type of sugar) is passed from the blood into cells for conversion to energy. Lack of insulin results in the inability to use glucose for energy or to control the amount of sugar in the blood.Type 1 diabetes can occur at any age, from early childhood to late adulthood. The first signs and symptoms of the disorder are caused by high blood sugar and may include frequent urination (polyuria), excessive thirst (polydipsia), fatigue, blurred vision, tingling or loss of feeling in the hands and feet, and weight loss. These symptoms may recur during the course of the disorder if blood sugar is not well controlled by insulin replacement therapy. Improper control can also cause blood sugar levels to become too low (hypoglycemia). This may occur when the body's needs change, such as during exercise or if eating is delayed. Hypoglycemia can cause headache, dizziness, hunger, shaking, sweating, weakness, and agitation.Uncontrolled type 1 diabetes can lead to a life-threatening complication called diabetic ketoacidosis. Without insulin, cells cannot take in glucose. A lack of glucose in cells prompts the liver to try to compensate by releasing more glucose into the blood, and blood sugar can become extremely high. The cells, unable to use the glucose in the blood for energy, respond by using fats instead. Breaking down fats to obtain energy produces waste products called ketones, which can build up to toxic levels in people with type 1 diabetes, resulting in diabetic ketoacidosis. Affected individuals may begin breathing rapidly; develop a fruity odor in the breath; and experience nausea, vomiting, facial flushing, stomach pain, and dryness of the mouth (xerostomia). In severe cases, diabetic ketoacidosis can lead to coma and death.Over many years, the chronic high blood sugar associated with diabetes may cause damage to blood vessels and nerves, leading to complications affecting many organs and tissues. The retina, which is the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye, can be damaged (diabetic retinopathy), leading to vision loss and eventual blindness. Kidney damage (diabetic nephropathy) may also occur and can lead to kidney failure and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Pain, tingling, and loss of normal sensation (diabetic neuropathy) often occur, especially in the feet. Impaired circulation and absence of the normal sensations that prompt reaction to injury can result in permanent damage to the feet; in severe cases, the damage can lead to amputation. People with type 1 diabetes are also at increased risk of heart attacks, strokes, and problems with urinary and sexual function.","xrefs":["{\"db\":\"MONDO\",\"id\":\"MONDO:0012921\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"612522\",\"type\":\"MIM\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"612522\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_symbols\",\"ref_field_element\":\"IDDM22\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Alliance\",\"id\":\"Diabetes+mellitus%2C+insulin-dependent%2C+22/8220\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"type-1-diabetes\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"612522\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"symbol\"}"],"name":"Diabetes mellitus, insulin-dependent, 22","keywords":[],"attribute_content":[],"medgen_id":"C2675864"}

{"alternate_names":["SYSTEMIC LUPUS ERYTHEMATOSUS, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, 6"],"type":"Disease","alternate_symbols":[],"symbol":"SLEB6","id":"4525","public_definition":"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic disease that causes inflammation in connective tissues, such as cartilage and the lining of blood vessels, which provide strength and flexibility to structures throughout the body. The signs and symptoms of SLE vary among affected individuals, and can involve many organs and systems, including the skin, joints, kidneys, lungs, central nervous system, and blood-forming (hematopoietic) system. SLE is one of a large group of conditions called autoimmune disorders that occur when the immune system attacks the body's own tissues and organs.SLE may first appear as extreme tiredness (fatigue), a vague feeling of discomfort or illness (malaise), fever, loss of appetite, and weight loss. Most affected individuals also have joint pain, typically affecting the same joints on both sides of the body, and muscle pain and weakness. Skin problems are common in SLE. A characteristic feature is a flat red rash across the cheeks and bridge of the nose, called a \"butterfly rash\" because of its shape. The rash, which generally does not hurt or itch, often appears or becomes more pronounced when exposed to sunlight. Other skin problems that may occur in SLE include calcium deposits under the skin (calcinosis), damaged blood vessels (vasculitis) in the skin, and tiny red spots called petechiae. Petechiae are caused by a shortage of cells involved in clotting (platelets), which leads to bleeding under the skin. Affected individuals may also have hair loss (alopecia) and open sores (ulcerations) in the moist lining (mucosae) of the mouth, nose, or, less commonly, the genitals.About a third of people with SLE develop kidney disease (nephritis). Heart problems may also occur in SLE, including inflammation of the sac-like membrane around the heart (pericarditis) and abnormalities of the heart valves, which control blood flow in the heart. Heart disease caused by fatty buildup in the blood vessels (atherosclerosis), which is very common in the general population, is even more common in people with SLE. The inflammation characteristic of SLE can also damage the nervous system, and may result in abnormal sensation and weakness in the limbs (peripheral neuropathy); seizures; stroke; and difficulty processing, learning, and remembering information (cognitive impairment). Anxiety and depression are also common in SLE.People with SLE have episodes in which the condition gets worse (exacerbations) and other times when it gets better (remissions). Overall, SLE gradually gets worse over time, and damage to the major organs of the body can be life-threatening.","xrefs":["{\"db\":\"MONDO\",\"id\":\"MONDO:0012369\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"609939\",\"type\":\"MIM\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"609939\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"SYSTEMIC LUPUS ERYTHEMATOSUS, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, 6\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"systemic-lupus-erythematosus\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"609939\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"symbol\"}"],"name":"Systemic lupus erythematosus 6","keywords":[],"attribute_content":[],"medgen_id":"C1835919"}
