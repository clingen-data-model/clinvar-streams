{"medgen_id":"C3178805","public_definition":"Heterotaxy syndrome is a condition in which the internal organs are abnormally arranged in the chest and abdomen. The term \"heterotaxy\" is from the Greek words \"heteros,\" meaning \"other than,\" and \"taxis,\" meaning \"arrangement.\" Individuals with this condition have complex birth defects affecting the heart, lungs, liver, spleen, intestines, and other organs.In the normal body, most of the organs in the chest and abdomen have a particular location on the right or left side. For example, the heart, spleen, and pancreas are on the left side of the body, and most of the liver is on the right. This normal arrangement of the organs is known as \"situs solitus.\" Rarely, the orientation of the internal organs is completely flipped from right to left, a situation known as \"situs inversus.\" This mirror-image orientation usually does not cause any health problems, unless it occurs as part of a syndrome affecting other parts of the body. Heterotaxy syndrome is an arrangement of internal organs somewhere between situs solitus and situs inversus; this condition is also known as \"situs ambiguus.\" Unlike situs inversus, the abnormal arrangement of organs in heterotaxy syndrome often causes serious health problems.Heterotaxy syndrome can alter the structure of the heart, including the attachment of the large blood vessels that carry blood to and from the rest of the body. It can also affect the structure of the lungs, such as the number of lobes in each lung and the length of the tubes (called bronchi) that lead from the windpipe to the lungs. In the abdomen, the condition can cause a person to have no spleen (asplenia) or multiple small, poorly functioning spleens (polysplenia). The liver may lie across the middle of the body instead of being in its normal position to the right of the stomach. Some affected individuals also have intestinal malrotation, which is an abnormal twisting of the intestines that occurs in the early stages of development before birth.Depending on the organs involved, signs and symptoms of heterotaxy syndrome can include a bluish appearance of the skin or lips (cyanosis, which is due to a shortage of oxygen), breathing difficulties, an increased risk of infections, and problems with digesting food. The most serious complications are generally caused by critical congenital heart disease, a group of complex heart defects that are present from birth. Biliary atresia, a problem with the bile ducts in the liver, can also cause severe health problems in infancy.The severity of heterotaxy syndrome varies depending on the specific abnormalities involved. Some affected individuals have only mild health problems related to the condition. At the other end of the spectrum, heterotaxy syndrome can be life-threatening in infancy or childhood, even with treatment.","alternate_symbols":[],"keywords":[],"attribute_content":[],"id":"16650","alternate_names":["Heterotaxy syndrome"],"type":"Disease","xrefs":["{\"db\":\"Human Phenotype Ontology\",\"id\":\"MONDO:0018677\",\"type\":\"primary\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"450\"}","{\"db\":\"NCI\",\"id\":\"C117273\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"Heterotaxy syndrome\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"450\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"heterotaxy-syndrome\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}"],"name":"Heterotaxia"}

{"medgen_id":"C2981140","public_definition":"Glaucoma is a group of eye disorders in which the optic nerves connecting the eyes and the brain are progressively damaged. This damage can lead to reduction in side (peripheral) vision and eventual blindness. Other signs and symptoms may include bulging eyes, excessive tearing, and abnormal sensitivity to light (photophobia). The term \"early-onset glaucoma\" may be used when the disorder appears before the age of 40.In most people with glaucoma, the damage to the optic nerves is caused by increased pressure within the eyes (intraocular pressure). Intraocular pressure depends on a balance between fluid entering and leaving the eyes.Usually glaucoma develops in older adults, in whom the risk of developing the disorder may be affected by a variety of medical conditions including high blood pressure (hypertension) and diabetes mellitus, as well as family history. The risk of early-onset glaucoma depends mainly on heredity.Structural abnormalities that impede fluid drainage in the eye may be present at birth and usually become apparent during the first year of life. Such abnormalities may be part of a genetic disorder that affects many body systems, called a syndrome. If glaucoma appears before the age of 5 without other associated abnormalities, it is called primary congenital glaucoma.Other individuals experience early onset of primary open-angle glaucoma, the most common adult form of glaucoma. If primary open-angle glaucoma develops during childhood or early adulthood, it is called juvenile open-angle glaucoma.","alternate_symbols":[],"keywords":[],"attribute_content":[],"id":"22162","alternate_names":["Childhood glaucoma","Developmental glaucoma","Infantile glaucoma","Pediatric glaucoma"],"type":"Disease","xrefs":["{\"db\":\"Human Phenotype Ontology\",\"id\":\"HP:0001087\",\"type\":\"primary\"}","{\"db\":\"MONDO\",\"id\":\"MONDO:0020367\"}","{\"db\":\"Human Phenotype Ontology\",\"id\":\"HP:0001087\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"Developmental glaucoma\"}","{\"db\":\"SNOMED CT\",\"id\":\"71111008\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"early-onset-glaucoma\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}"],"name":"Glaucoma of childhood"}
{"medgen_id":"C1968949","public_definition":"Congenital anomalies of kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) is a group of abnormalities affecting the kidneys or other structures of the urinary tract. The additional parts of the urinary tract that may be affected include the bladder, the tubes that carry urine from each kidney to the bladder (the ureters), and the tube that carries urine from the bladder out of the body (the urethra). CAKUT results from abnormal development of the urinary system and is present from birth (congenital), although the abnormality may not become apparent until later in life.Individuals with CAKUT have one or more kidney or urinary tract abnormalities. For paired structures, like the kidneys and ureters, one or both may be affected. Many different developmental abnormalities are classified as CAKUT, including underdevelopment or absence of a kidney (renal hypodysplasia or agenesis), a kidney formed of fluid-filled sacs called cysts (multicystic dysplastic kidney), buildup of urine in the kidneys (hydronephrosis), an extra ureter leading to the kidney (duplex kidney or duplicated collecting system), a blockage in a ureter where it joins the kidney (ureteropelvic junction obstruction), an abnormally wide ureter (megaureter), backflow of urine from the bladder into the ureter (vesicoureteral reflux), and an abnormal membrane in the urethra that blocks the flow of urine out of the bladder (posterior urethral valve).CAKUT varies in severity. The abnormalities can result in recurrent urinary tract infections or a buildup of urine in the urinary tract, which may damage the kidneys or other structures. Severe CAKUT can result in life-threatening kidney failure and end-stage renal disease.CAKUT is often one of several features of a condition that affects multiple body systems (syndromic CAKUT). For example, renal coloboma syndrome, 17q12 deletion syndrome, renal cysts and diabetes (RCAD) syndrome, Fraser syndrome, Townes-Brocks syndrome, and branchio-oto-renal syndrome can cause kidney or urinary tract abnormalities in addition to other problems. However, urinary system abnormalities sometimes occur without other signs and symptoms, which is known as nonsyndromic or isolated CAKUT.","alternate_symbols":[],"keywords":[],"attribute_content":[],"symbol":"CAKUT","id":"34805","alternate_names":["Congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract"],"type":"Disease","xrefs":["{\"db\":\"MONDO\",\"id\":\"MONDO:0019719\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"PS610805\",\"type\":\"Phenotypic series\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"93545\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"PS610805\",\"type\":\"Phenotypic series\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"congenital-anomalies-of-kidney-and-urinary-tract\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}"],"name":"Congenital anomalies of kidney and urinary tract"}

{"medgen_id":"C1867773","public_definition":"Hereditary cerebral amyloid angiopathy is a condition that can cause a progressive loss of intellectual function (dementia), stroke, and other neurological problems starting in mid-adulthood. Due to neurological decline, this condition is typically fatal in one's sixties, although there is variation depending on the severity of the signs and symptoms. Most affected individuals die within a decade after signs and symptoms first appear, although some people with the disease have survived longer.There are many different types of hereditary cerebral amyloid angiopathy. The different types are distinguished by their genetic cause and the signs and symptoms that occur. The various types of hereditary cerebral amyloid angiopathy are named after the regions where they were first diagnosed.The Dutch type of hereditary cerebral amyloid angiopathy is the most common form. Stroke is frequently the first sign of the Dutch type and is fatal in about one third of people who have this condition. Survivors often develop dementia and have recurrent strokes. About half of individuals with the Dutch type who have one or more strokes will have recurrent seizures (epilepsy).People with the Flemish and Italian types of hereditary cerebral amyloid angiopathy are prone to recurrent strokes and dementia. Individuals with the Piedmont type may have one or more strokes and typically experience impaired movements, numbness or tingling (paresthesias), confusion, or dementia.The first sign of the Icelandic type of hereditary cerebral amyloid angiopathy is typically a stroke followed by dementia. Strokes associated with the Icelandic type usually occur earlier than the other types, with individuals typically experiencing their first stroke in their twenties or thirties.Strokes are rare in people with the Arctic type of hereditary cerebral amyloid angiopathy, in which the first sign is usually memory loss that then progresses to severe dementia. Strokes are also uncommon in individuals with the Iowa type. This type is characterized by memory loss, problems with vocabulary and the production of speech, personality changes, and involuntary muscle twitches (myoclonus).Two types of hereditary cerebral amyloid angiopathy, known as familial British dementia and familial Danish dementia, are characterized by dementia and movement problems. Strokes are uncommon in these types. People with the Danish type may also have clouding of the lens of the eyes (cataracts) or deafness.","alternate_symbols":[],"keywords":[],"attribute_content":[],"symbol":"FBD","id":"867","gard_id":"8344","alternate_names":["CEREBRAL AMYLOID ANGIOPATHY, ITM2B-RELATED, 1","Cerebral amyloid angiopathy, British type","Dementia familial British","Presenile dementia with spastic ataxia"],"type":"Disease","xrefs":["{\"db\":\"MONDO\",\"id\":\"MONDO:0008306\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"176500\",\"type\":\"MIM\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"439254\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"97345\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"176500\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"CEREBRAL AMYLOID ANGIOPATHY, ITM2B-RELATED, 1\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Alliance\",\"id\":\"Dementia+Familial+British/2182\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"Dementia familial British\"}","{\"db\":\"Office of Rare Diseases\",\"id\":\"8344\",\"ref_field\":\"gard_id\"}","{\"db\":\"MONDO\",\"id\":\"MONDO:0008306\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"hereditary-cerebral-amyloid-angiopathy\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"176500\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"symbol\"}"],"name":"ABri amyloidosis"}

Onset of the manifestations of isolated methylmalonic acidemia/aciduria ranges from the neonatal period to adulthood. All phenotypes are characterized by periods of relative health and intermittent metabolic decompensation, usually associated with intercurrent infections and stress. In the neonatal period the disease can present with lethargy, vomiting, hypotonia, hypothermia, respiratory distress, severe ketoacidosis, hyperammonemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia and can result in death within the first four weeks of life. In the infantile/non-B12-responsive phenotype, infants are normal at birth, but develop lethargy, vomiting, dehydration, failure to thrive, hepatomegaly, hypotonia, and encephalopathy within a few weeks to months of age. An intermediate B12-responsive phenotype can occasionally be observed in neonates, but is usually observed in the first months or years of life; affected children exhibit anorexia, failure to thrive, hypotonia, and developmental delay, and sometimes have protein aversion and/or vomiting and lethargy after protein intake. Atypical and \"benign\"/adult methylmalonic acidemia phenotypes are associated with increased, albeit mild, urinary excretion of methylmalonate.

{"medgen_id":"C0175778","public_definition":"The FLNB disorders include a spectrum of phenotypes ranging from mild to severe. At the mild end are spondylocarpotarsal synostosis (SCT) syndrome and Larsen syndrome; at the severe end are the phenotypic continuum of atelosteogenesis types I (AOI) and III (AOIII) and Piepkorn osteochondrodysplasia (POCD). SCT syndrome is characterized by postnatal disproportionate short stature, scoliosis and lordosis, clubfeet, hearing loss, dental enamel hypoplasia, carpal and tarsal synostosis, and vertebral fusions. Larsen syndrome is characterized by congenital dislocations of the hip, knee, and elbow; clubfeet (equinovarus or equinovalgus foot deformities); scoliosis and cervical kyphosis, which can be associated with a cervical myelopathy; short, broad, spatulate distal phalanges; distinctive craniofacies (prominent forehead, depressed nasal bridge, malar flattening, and widely spaced eyes); vertebral anomalies; and supernumerary carpal and tarsal bone ossification centers. Individuals with SCT syndrome and Larsen syndrome can have midline cleft palate and hearing loss. AOI and AOIII are characterized by severe short-limbed dwarfism; dislocated hips, knees, and elbows; and clubfeet. AOI is lethal in the perinatal period. In individuals with AOIII, survival beyond the neonatal period is possible with intensive and invasive respiratory support. Piepkorn osteochondrodysplasia (POCD) is a perinatal-lethal micromelic dwarfism characterized by flipper-like limbs (polysyndactyly with complete syndactyly of all fingers and toes, hypoplastic or absent first digits, and duplicated intermediate and distal phalanges), macrobrachycephaly, prominant forehead, hypertelorism, and exophthalmos. Occasional features include cleft palate, omphalocele, and cardiac and genitourinary anomalies. The radiographic features at mid-gestation are characteristic.","alternate_symbols":["LRS1"],"keywords":[],"attribute_content":[],"symbol":"LRS","id":"14587","alternate_names":["Bilateral dislocation of the knees, pes cavus, cylindrically shaped fingers and characteristic facies","Larsen syndrome, dominant type"],"type":"Disease","xrefs":["{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"150250\",\"type\":\"MIM\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"503\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Alliance\",\"id\":\"Larsen+syndrome%2C+dominant+type/4094\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"Larsen syndrome, dominant type\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000508858\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000512698\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000522271\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000522272\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Alliance\",\"id\":\"Larsen+syndrome/4093\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"larsen-syndrome\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"SNOMED CT\",\"id\":\"63387002\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"GeneReviews\",\"id\":\"NBK2534\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"150250\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"symbol\"}"],"content":"{\"Citation\":{\"@Abbrev\":\"GeneReviews\",\"@Type\":\"review\",\"ID\":[{\"$\":\"20301736\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"},{\"$\":\"NBK2534\",\"@Source\":\"BookShelf\"}]}}","name":"Larsen syndrome","disease_mechanism":"loss of function","disease_mechanism_id":"273"}
{"medgen_id":"C1832200","public_definition":"Zellweger spectrum disorder (ZSD) is a phenotypic continuum ranging from severe to mild. While individual phenotypes (e.g., Zellweger syndrome [ZS], neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy [NALD], and infantile Refsum disease [IRD]) were described in the past before the biochemical and molecular bases of this spectrum were fully determined, the term \"ZSD\" is now used to refer to all individuals with a defect in one of the ZSD-PEX genes regardless of phenotype. Individuals with ZSD usually come to clinical attention in the newborn period or later in childhood. Affected newborns are hypotonic and feed poorly. They have distinctive facies, congenital malformations (neuronal migration defects associated with neonatal-onset seizures, renal cysts, and bony stippling [chondrodysplasia punctata] of the patella[e] and the long bones), and liver disease that can be severe. Infants with severe ZSD are significantly impaired and typically die during the first year of life, usually having made no developmental progress. Individuals with intermediate/milder ZSD do not have congenital malformations, but rather progressive peroxisome dysfunction variably manifest as sensory loss (secondary to retinal dystrophy and sensorineural hearing loss), neurologic involvement (ataxia, polyneuropathy, and leukodystrophy), liver dysfunction, adrenal insufficiency, and renal oxalate stones. While hypotonia and developmental delays are typical, intellect can be normal.

In middle age, most males successfully treated for ESRD develop cardiac and/or cerebrovascular disease, a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Heterozygous females typically have milder symptoms at a later age of onset than males. Rarely, they may be relatively asymptomatic throughout a normal life span or may have symptoms as severe as those observed in males with the classic phenotype.
