{"interpretation_comments":["{\"text\":\"The c.375+5G\u003eA intronic variant results from a G to A substitution 5 nucleotides after coding exon 3 in the TP53 gene. cDNA obtained from frozen lung carcinoma tissue indicate multiple abnormally spliced transcripts are present, however, quantitation is not available, and the degree to which splicing is affected cannot be determined (Smardova J et al. Oncol. Rep., 2016 Mar;35:1859-67). This nucleotide position is highly conserved in available vertebrate species. Using two different splice site prediction tools, this alteration is predicted by BDGP to abolish the native splice donor site, but is predicted to weaken (but not abolish) the efficiency of the native splice donor site by ESEfinder; however, direct evidence is unavailable. Since supporting evidence is limited at this time, the clinical significance of this alteration remains unclear.\"}"],"trait_set_id":"13598","submission_names":["NonExomeUpdate_081220AmbryReport"],"internal_id":"1300505","version":"3","submission_id":"61756.2020-11-30","submitted_assembly":"GRCh37","content":"{\"AttributeSet\":{\"Attribute\":{\"$\":\"Ambry Autosomal Dominant and X-Linked criteria (2/2020)\",\"@Type\":\"AssertionMethod\"},\"Citation\":{\"URL\":{\"$\":\"https://submit.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ft/byid/izn1iuef/variant_classificationscheme_02.2020_ambry.pdf\"}}},\"ClinVarSubmissionID\":{\"@localKeyIsSubmitted\":\"1\"},\"Interpretation\":{\"Citation\":{\"ID\":{\"$\":\"26718964\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"}}}}","record_status":"current","clinical_assertion_observation_ids":["SCV000665087.0"],"date_last_updated":"2020-12-08","submitter_id":"61756","review_status":"criteria provided, single submitter","rcv_accession_id":"RCV000567707","id":"SCV000665087","interpretation_description":"Uncertain significance","clinical_assertion_trait_set_id":"SCV000665087","local_key":"a626669","variation_archive_id":"VCV000481015","interpretation_date_last_evaluated":"2020-05-14","variation_id":"481015","assertion_type":"variation to disease","date_created":"2017-12-28"}
