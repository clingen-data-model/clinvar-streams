This variant has been observed in trans to a pathogenic variant in affected individuals (Corton 2013); however, it has also been observed in cis to a nonsense variant in at least one study (Sciezynska 2016). The p.Val2050Leu variant is found in the Latino population with an overall allele frequency of 0.60% (211/35438 alleles) in the Genome Aggregation Database and is reported with conflicting classifications in ClinVar (Variation ID: 7884). The leucine at codon 2050 is highly conserved, but computational analyses (SIFT: tolerated, PolyPhen-2: damaging) predict conflicting effects of this variant on protein structure/function. Due to conflicting information, the clinical significance of the p.Val2050Leu variant is uncertain at this time. References: Allikmets R et al.
