It is characterized by skeletal abnormalities, hearing loss, and distinctive facial features. The features of this condition significantly overlap those of two similar conditions, otospondylomegaepiphyseal dysplasia (OSMED) and Stickler syndrome type III. All of these conditions are caused by mutations in the same gene, and in some cases, it can be difficult to tell them apart. Some researchers believe they represent a single disorder with a range of signs and symptoms.Infants born with Weissenbacher-Zweym端ller syndrome are smaller than average because the bones in their arms and legs are unusually short. The thigh and upper arm bones are wider than usual at the ends (described as dumbbell-shaped), and the bones of the spine (vertebrae) may also be abnormally shaped. High-frequency hearing loss occurs in some cases. Distinctive facial features include wide-set protruding eyes, a small and upturned nose with a flat bridge, and a small lower jaw. Some affected infants are born with an opening in the roof of the mouth (a cleft palate).Most people with Weissenbacher-Zweym端ller syndrome experience significant \"catch-up\" growth in the bones of the arms and legs during childhood. As a result, adults with this condition are not unusually short. However, affected adults still have other signs and symptoms of Weissenbacher-Zweym端ller syndrome, including distinctive facial features and hearing loss.","xrefs":["{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"3450\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Alliance\",\"id\":\"Weissenbacher-Zweymuller+syndrome/7463\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Office of Rare Diseases\",\"id\":\"4351\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"weissenbacher-zweymuller-syndrome\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"277610\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"symbol\"}","{\"db\":\"Office of Rare Diseases\",\"id\":\"4351\",\"ref_field\":\"symbol\"}"],"id":"4500"}

The muscles most affected are those closest to the body (proximal muscles), specifically the muscles of the shoulders, upper arms, pelvic area, and thighs.The severity, age of onset, and features of limb-girdle muscle dystrophy vary among the many subtypes of this condition and may be inconsistent even within the same family. Signs and symptoms may first appear at any age and generally worsen with time, although in some cases they remain mild.In the early stages of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, affected individuals may have an unusual walking gait, such as waddling or walking on the balls of their feet, and may also have difficulty running. They may need to use their arms to press themselves up from a squatting position because of their weak thigh muscles. As the condition progresses, people with limb-girdle muscular dystrophy may eventually require wheelchair assistance.Muscle wasting may cause changes in posture or in the appearance of the shoulder, back, and arm. In particular, weak shoulder muscles tend to make the shoulder blades (scapulae) \"stick out\" from the back, a sign known as scapular winging. Affected individuals may also have an abnormally curved lower back (lordosis) or a spine that curves to the side (scoliosis). Some develop joint stiffness (contractures) that can restrict movement in their hips, knees, ankles, or elbows. Overgrowth (hypertrophy) of the calf muscles occurs in some people with limb-girdle muscular dystrophy.Weakening of the heart muscle (cardiomyopathy) occurs in some forms of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy. Some affected individuals experience mild to severe breathing problems related to the weakness of muscles needed for breathing. In some cases, the breathing problems are severe enough that affected individuals need to use a machine to help them breathe (mechanical ventilation).Intelligence is generally unaffected in limb-girdle muscular dystrophy; however, developmental delay and intellectual disability have been reported in rare forms of the disorder.","xrefs":["{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"607801\",\"type\":\"MIM\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"265\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Alliance\",\"id\":\"Limb-girdle+muscular+dystrophy%2C+type+1C/8748\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"limb-girdle-muscular-dystrophy\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"607801\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"symbol\"}"],"id":"3062"}
{"attribute_content":[],"medgen_id":"C1836122","keywords":[],"alternate_symbols":[],"type":"Disease","symbol":"EOS","name":"Sarcoidosis, early-onset","alternate_names":[],"public_definition":"Blau syndrome is an inflammatory disorder that primarily affects the skin, joints, and eyes. Signs and symptoms begin in childhood, usually before age 4.A form of skin inflammation called granulomatous dermatitis is typically the earliest sign of Blau syndrome. This skin condition causes a persistent rash that can be scaly or involve hard lumps (nodules) that can be felt under the skin. The rash is usually found on the torso, arms, and legs.Arthritis is another common feature of Blau syndrome. In affected individuals, arthritis is characterized by inflammation of the lining of joints (the synovium). This inflammation, known as synovitis, is associated with swelling and joint pain. Synovitis usually begins in the joints of the hands, feet, wrists, and ankles. As the condition worsens, it can involve additional joints and restrict movement by decreasing the range of motion in many joints.Most people with Blau syndrome also develop uveitis, which is swelling and inflammation of the middle layer of the eye (the uvea). The uvea includes the colored portion of the eye (the iris) and related tissues that underlie the white part of the eye (the sclera). Uveitis can cause eye irritation and pain, increased sensitivity to bright light (photophobia), and blurred vision. Other structures in the eye can also become inflamed, including the outermost protective layer of the eye (the conjunctiva), the tear glands, the specialized light-sensitive tissue that lines the back of the eye (the retina), and the nerve that carries information from the eye to the brain (the optic nerve). Inflammation of any of these structures can lead to severe vision impairment or blindness.Some individuals with Blau syndrome develop kidney disease (nephritis) due to inflammation. They may also have deposits of calcium in the kidneys (nephrocalcinosis) and often develop chronic kidney failure. Inflammation of blood vessels (vasculitis) can cause scarring and tissue death in the vessels and impedes blood flow to tissues and organs.Less commonly, Blau syndrome can affect other parts of the body, including the liver, spleen, salivary gland, brain, blood vessels, lungs, and heart. Inflammation involving these organs and tissues can impair their function and cause life-threatening complications. Rarely, affected individuals have episodes of fever or high blood pressure in the blood vessels that carry blood from the heart to the lungs (pulmonary hypertension).","xrefs":["{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"609464\",\"type\":\"MIM\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"90341\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Alliance\",\"id\":\"Sarcoidosis%2C+early-onset/9263\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"blau-syndrome\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"609464\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"symbol\"}"],"id":"4368"}
