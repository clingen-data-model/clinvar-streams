MYBPC3 p.Arg502Trp This variant has been reported in at least 37 cases of HCM, with strong segregation data. Richard et al (2003) reported this variant in one individual with HCM in their French cohort. Van Driest et al (2004) observed this variant in an HCM patient who also carried p.Gly5Arg in MYBPC3. Details regarding phase and the severity of phenotype were not reported for this patient However, a comparison of the 10 patients, including this one, with multiple variants to the patients with a single variant revealed that the multiple variant group had, on average, a more severe phenotype. Ingles et al (2005) reported observing this variant in one case of HCM. Saltzman et al (2010) reported p.Arg502Trp in 34 of 1414 (2.4%) unrelated cases of HCM, making it the most common variant in that cohort. Four families had another sarcomere variant and individuals with multiple variants were more likely to have severe clinical outcomes. They noted that ~50% of carriers of p.Arg502Trp had overt disease by age 45. They reported a combined Lod score of 4.04 and noted that the likelihood that the observed cosegregation happened by chance was 1/11,000. The highest number of family members cosegregating HCM and the variant in one individual family was three. Note that this paper includes a pedigree reported online by the Seidman group (pedigree FU). Morita et al (2008) observed the variant in two unrelated children with HCM. In one of those cases and affected parent also had the variant. One of these children also carried p.Ser858Asn in MYBPC3 (phase not reported) Note that these families may have been included in the subsequent report by Saltzman et al. Liu et al (2006) reported a Chinese patient with HCM who carried both p.Arg502Trp and IVS27+12C\u003eT, also in MYBPC3. The arginine at codon 502 is highly conserved across species. This mutation results in a non-conservative amino acid change of a positively charged Arginine residue with a non-polar Tryptophan. In silico analysis with PolyPhen-2 predicts the variant to be probably damaging. Another variant at the same codon has been reported in association with HCM (p.Arg502Gln, which we consider very likely disease causing), as have variants in nearby codons (p.Arg495Gln, p.Lys505del, p.Gly507Arg). In total the variant has not been seen in ~395 published controls, including 100 (Richard et al 2003), 200 (van Driest et al 2004), 95 (Saltzman et al 2010). The variant was observed in 1 of 3472 Caucasians and 0 of 1826 African Americans in the NHLBI Exome Sequence Project dataset (as of 7/8/2014). Individual phenotypes from that dataset are not available. Several different cohorts from studies on common complex cardiovascular disease were pooled to create that sample. There is no variant at codon 502 listed in dbSNP or 1000 genomes (as of 7/8/2014).\",\"type\":\"public\"}"],"local_key":"NM_000256.3:c.1504C\u003eT|Not provided","id":"SCV000280214","variation_archive_id":"VCV000042540","internal_id":"528700","version":"1","date_last_updated":"2019-03-31","assertion_type":"variation to disease","trait_set_id":"9460","review_status":"no assertion criteria provided","submission_names":["5_6_2016"]}

Four families had another sarcomere variant and individuals with multiple variants were more likely to have severe clinical outcomes.

In total the variant has not been seen in ~395 published controls, including 100 (Richard et al 2003), 200 (van Driest et al 2004), 95 (Saltzman et al 2010). The variant was observed in 1 of 3472 Caucasians and 0 of 1826 African Americans in the NHLBI Exome Sequence Project dataset (as of 7/8/2014). Individual phenotypes from that dataset are not available. Several different cohorts from studies on common complex cardiovascular disease were pooled to create that sample.

Across a selection of the available literature, the p.Arg502Trp variant has been identified in heterozygous state in at least 44 individuals diagnosed with HCM. Two of the individuals carried another variant in the MYBPC3 gene in a compound heterozygous state with the p.Arg502Trp variant, and another 11 carried an additional variant in either MYBPC3 or another sarcomere gene (Richard et al. 2003; Van Driest et al. 2004; Ingles et al. 2005; Maron et al. 2008; Marston et al. 2009; Saltzman et al. 2010; Kaski et al. 2012; Lopes et al. 2013; Camuglia et al. 2013). The Arg502Trp variant has also been reported in a heterozygous state in three individuals diagnosed with left ventricular noncompaction cardiomyopathy. One of the individuals was the son of a female proband with HCM who also carried the variant in a heterozygous state. The two other individuals were the brother and nephew of another proband with HCM who also carried the variant in a heterozygous state (Camuglia et al. 2013). The p.Arg502Trp variant was absent from 945 controls (Van Driest et al. 2004; Saltzman et al. 2010) and is reported at a frequency of 0.0001026 in the European (non-Finnish) population of the Genome Aggregation Database. The variant has been shown to segregate with disease in multiple families (Saltzman et al. 2010). Based on the collective evidence, the p.Arg502Trp variant is classified as pathogenic for MYBPC3-related disorders.

Thus any internal case data may overlap with the internal case data of other labs. The interpretation reviewed below is that of the Stanford Center for Inherited Cardiovascular Disease. MYBPC3 p.Arg502Trp This variant has been reported in at least 37 cases of HCM, with strong segregation data. Richard et al (2003) reported this variant in one individual with HCM in their French cohort. Van Driest et al (2004) observed this variant in an HCM patient who also carried p.Gly5Arg in MYBPC3. Details regarding phase and the severity of phenotype were not reported for this patient However, a comparison of the 10 patients, including this one, with multiple variants to the patients with a single variant revealed that the multiple variant group had, on average, a more severe phenotype. Ingles et al (2005) reported observing this variant in one case of HCM. Saltzman et al (2010) reported p.Arg502Trp in 34 of 1414 (2.4%) unrelated cases of HCM, making it the most common variant in that cohort. Four families had another sarcomere variant and individuals with multiple variants were more likely to have severe clinical outcomes. They noted that ~50% of carriers of p.Arg502Trp had overt disease by age 45. They reported a combined Lod score of 4.04 and noted that the likelihood that the observed cosegregation happened by chance was 1/11,000. The highest number of family members cosegregating HCM and the variant in one individual family was three. Note that this paper includes a pedigree reported online by the Seidman group (pedigree FU). Morita et al (2008) observed the variant in two unrelated children with HCM. In one of those cases and affected parent also had the variant. One of these children also carried p.Ser858Asn in MYBPC3 (phase not reported) Note that these families may have been included in the subsequent report by Saltzman et al. Liu et al (2006) reported a Chinese patient with HCM who carried both p.Arg502Trp and IVS27+12C\u003eT, also in MYBPC3. The arginine at codon 502 is highly conserved across species. This mutation results in a non-conservative amino acid change of a positively charged Arginine residue with a non-polar Tryptophan. In silico analysis with PolyPhen-2 predicts the variant to be probably damaging. Another variant at the same codon has been reported in association with HCM (p.Arg502Gln, which we consider very likely disease causing), as have variants in nearby codons (p.Arg495Gln, p.Lys505del, p.Gly507Arg). In total the variant has not been seen in ~395 published controls, including 100 (Richard et al 2003), 200 (van Driest et al 2004), 95 (Saltzman et al 2010). The variant was observed in 1 of 3472 Caucasians and 0 of 1826 African Americans in the NHLBI Exome Sequence Project dataset (as of 7/8/2014). Individual phenotypes from that dataset are not available. Several different cohorts from studies on common complex cardiovascular disease were pooled to create that sample. There is no variant at codon 502 listed in dbSNP or 1000 genomes (as of 7/8/2014).\"}"],"record_status":"current","interpretation_description":"Pathogenic","variation_id":"42540"}

The p.Arg502Trp variant was absent from 945 controls (Van Driest et al. 2004; Saltzman et al. 2010) and is reported at a frequency of 0.0001026 in the European (non-Finnish) population of the Genome Aggregation Database. The variant has been shown to segregate with disease in multiple families (Saltzman et al. 2010). Based on the collective evidence, the p.Arg502Trp variant is classified as pathogenic for MYBPC3-related disorders.

Computational prediction tool is inconclusive regarding the impact of this variant on protein structure and function (internally defined REVEL score threshold 0.5 \u003c inconclusive \u003c 0.7, PMID: 27666373). Computational splicing tools suggest that this variant may not impact RNA splicing. An experimental functional study has shown that this variant causes loss of function with no evidence of the transcript or protein degradation and may alter kinetics of cardiac muscle contraction and relaxation (PMID: 30554920). This variant is known to be the most common and recurrent pathogenic mutation in a diverse, primarily European descent, cohort of individuals affected with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, occurring in 2.4% (34/1414) of patients (PMID: 20378854). This variant has been shown to segregate with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in over 25 families (PMID: 20378854, 22267749). This variant is thought to cause an estimated 340-fold increased risk for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy by 45 years of age, when more than 50% of carriers have overt disease (PMID: 20378854). This variant has also been reported in multiple unrelated affected individuals, including children with severe phenotype (PMID: 12707239, 22555271, 23054336, 23396983, 23711808).

This mutation has been reported in multiple unrelated patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), including individuals with pediatric and adult-onset HCM, and in several individuals with multiple sarcomeric gene mutations, and has been reported to segregate with disease in families (Richard P et al. Circulation. 2003;107(17):2227-32; Van Driest SL et al. J Am Coll Cardiol. 2004;44(9):1903-10; Saltzman AJ et al. Circ Res. 2010;106(9):1549-52; Kaski JP et al. Circ Cardiovasc Genet. 2012;5(3):317-26). This mutation is in the C3 domain of cMyBP-C and alters the electrostatic properties, which may disrupt protein-protein interactions (Zhang XL et al. Biochemistry. 2014;53(32):5332-42). In addition, other alterations affecting this amino acid (p. R502Q, c.1505G\u003eA and p.R502G, c.1504C\u003eG) have been previously reported in association with HCM (Niimura H et al. N Engl J Med. 1998;338(18):1248-57; Liu X et al. Sci Rep. 2015;5:11411). Based on the supporting evidence, p.R502W is interpreted as a disease-causing mutation.\"}"],"rcv_accession_id":"RCV000252398","variation_archive_id":"VCV000042540","version":"5","date_last_updated":"2020-12-07","variation_id":"42540","clinical_assertion_observation_ids":["SCV000319017.0"],"trait_set_id":"32616","record_status":"current","submitter_id":"61756","submitted_assembly":"GRCh37","assertion_type":"variation to disease","review_status":"criteria provided, single submitter"}
