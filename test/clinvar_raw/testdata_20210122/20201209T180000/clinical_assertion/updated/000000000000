This alteration is present in 6-7% of the Ashkenazi Jewish population and has been reported at even higher frequencies in Ashkenazi Jewish colorectal cancer (CRC) and adenomatous polyp cohorts (Gryfe R et al. Am J. Hum. Genet. 1999 Feb;64:378-84; Syngal S et al. JAMA. 2000 Aug;284:857-60; Stern HS et al. Gasteroenterol. 2001 Feb;120:392-400). One recent study of over 2200 Ashkenazi Jewish individuals reported an even higher prevalence (10.1%) of this mutation in the general Ashkenazi Jewish population (Boursi B et al. Eur. J. Cancer. 2013 Nov;49:3680-5). The magnitude of CRC risk associated with p.I1307K has been debated in the literature; however, a meta-analysis of data from numerous independent studies found that p.I1307K confers a moderate increase (OR=2.17, 95% CI=1.64-2.86) in lifetime CRC risk in the Ashkenazi Jewish population (Liang J et al. Am. J. Epidemiol. 2013 Jun;177:1169-79). Associations between p.I1307K and CRC risk in non-Ashkenazi Jewish populations and the risk of other malignancies for p.I1307K carriers have not been well defined, but one study found a statistically significant association between this allele and extra-colonic malignancies (95% CI 2.11-3.04 p\u003c0.0001); and another case-control study in an Egyptian population found a similar association with colorectal cancer as reported in the Ashkenazi Jewish population (OR=2.588, 95% CI=1.90-6.09) (Leshno A et al. Int. J. Cancer. 2016 Mar;138:1361-7; Abdel-Malak C et al. Fam. Cancer. 2016 Jan;15:49-56).
