It does not directly change the encoded amino acid sequence of the TP53 protein, but it affects a nucleotide within the consensus splice site of the intron. This variant is not present in population databases (ExAC no frequency). This variant has not been reported in the literature in individuals with TP53-related conditions. ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 481015). Nucleotide substitutions within the consensus splice site are a relatively common cause of aberrant splicing (PMID: 17576681, 9536098). Algorithms developed to predict the effect of sequence changes on RNA splicing suggest that this variant may disrupt the consensus splice site, but this prediction has not been confirmed by published transcriptional studies. In summary, the available evidence is currently insufficient to determine the role of this variant in disease. Therefore, it has been classified as a Variant of Uncertain Significance.\"}"],"date_last_updated":"2020-04-15","date_created":"2020-04-12","submission_names":["SUB6933801"],"variation_id":"481015","variation_archive_id":"VCV000481015","rcv_accession_id":"RCV001046561"}
