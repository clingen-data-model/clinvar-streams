Cardiac and smooth muscle are usually not involved. Severity and course of disease are highly variable, ranging from minor symptoms to progressive disabling weakness. In some subtypes of CMS, myasthenic symptoms may be mild, but sudden severe exacerbations of weakness or even sudden episodes of respiratory insufficiency may be precipitated by fever, infections, or excitement. Major findings of the neonatal-onset subtype include: respiratory insufficiency with sudden apnea and cyanosis; feeding difficulties; poor suck and cry; choking spells; eyelid ptosis; and facial, bulbar, and generalized weakness. Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita may also be present. Stridor in infancy may be an important clue to CMS. Later childhood-onset subtypes show abnormal muscle fatigability with difficulty in activities such as running or climbing stairs; motor milestones may be delayed; fluctuating eyelid ptosis and fixed or fluctuating extraocular muscle weakness are common presentations.","xrefs":["{\"db\":\"MONDO\",\"id\":\"MONDO:0011088\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"601462\",\"type\":\"MIM\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"601462\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"CMS IIa\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"100690.0001\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"MYASTHENIC SYNDROME, CONGENITAL, 1A, SLOW-CHANNEL\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"100690.0002\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"MYASTHENIC SYNDROME, CONGENITAL, 1A, SLOW-CHANNEL\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"100690.0003\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"MYASTHENIC SYNDROME, CONGENITAL, 1A, SLOW-CHANNEL\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"100690.0004\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"MYASTHENIC SYNDROME, CONGENITAL, 1A, SLOW-CHANNEL\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"100690.0005\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"MYASTHENIC SYNDROME, CONGENITAL, 1A, SLOW-CHANNEL\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"100690.0006\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"MYASTHENIC SYNDROME, CONGENITAL, 1A, SLOW-CHANNEL\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"100690.0012\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"MYASTHENIC SYNDROME, CONGENITAL, 1A, SLOW-CHANNEL\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"601462\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"MYASTHENIC SYNDROME, CONGENITAL, 1A, SLOW-CHANNEL\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"601462\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_symbols\",\"ref_field_element\":\"CMS2A\"}","{\"db\":\"MONDO\",\"id\":\" 601462\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"GeneReviews\",\"id\":\"NBK1168\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"601462\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"symbol\"}"],"keywords":[],"attribute_content":[],"content":"{\"Citation\":{\"@Abbrev\":\"GeneReviews\",\"@Type\":\"review\",\"ID\":[{\"$\":\"20301347\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"},{\"$\":\"NBK1168\",\"@Source\":\"BookShelf\"}]}}","id":"54545","type":"Disease"}
