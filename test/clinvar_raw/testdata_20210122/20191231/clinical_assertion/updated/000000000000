Poloschek et al. (2010) reported that V2050L heterozygous carriers show centrally reduced mfERG amplitudes and additional minor fundus abnormalities, which suggested that the V2050L variant in the heterozygous state is capable of mildly reducing macular function without an additional pathogenic variant on the second allele. However, the V2050L variant is observed in 202/34420 (0.5869%) alleles from individuals of Latino background and 787/277174 (0.2839%) global alleles, with one homozygote reported (Lek et al., 2016). The V2050L variant is a conservative amino acid substitution, which occurs at a position that is conserved across species.

Three of five in-silico tools predict a benign effect of the variant on protein function. The variant allele was found at a frequency of 0.002 in 251040 control chromosomes in the gnomAD database (exomes dataset), predominantly found within the Ashkenazi Jewish subpopulation at a frequency of 0.036, including 7 homozygotes. The observed variant frequency within Ashkenazi Jewish control individuals in the gnomAD database is approximately 500 fold of the estimated maximal expected allele frequency for a pathogenic variant in APC causing Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP) phenotype (7.1e-05), strongly suggesting that the variant is a benign polymorphism found primarily in populations of Ashkenazi Jewish origin. The variant, c.3920T\u003eA, has been reported in the literature in multiple individuals affected with colorectal cancer (CRC) and other tumor phenotypes, however in some of these cases it was also reported to co-occur with other pathogenic variants (Yurgelun_2017 and Simbolo_2015). Multiple case-control studies (Abdel-Malak_2016, Drucker_2000, Fidder_2005, Gryfe_1998, Laken_1997, Leshno_2016, and Shtoyerman-Chen_2001), demonstrated that this variant is associated with a moderately increased risk for CRC in Ashkenazi Jewish population. A large meta-analysis concluded that the variant increases the risk about two-fold for CRC in individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry (OR=2.17, 95% CI=1.65-2.86), however it does not appear to confer an additional risk for CRC in non-Ashkenazi cases (Liang_2013). A recent case-control study involving a large Israeli cohort indicated that this variant might be also associated with a significantly higher risk for non-CRC cancers, with the APC I1307K variant being proposed as a reliable marker for overall cancer risk (OR=2.53) (Leshno_2016). The A8 mononucleotide tract created by this germline change has been shown to confer an increased propensity for generating somatic frameshift mutations on this allele, leading to a loss of function of APC that constitutes an important somatic event in tumor initiation (Gryfe_1998; Laken_1997). 19 other submitters have provided clinical-significance assessments for this variant to ClinVar after 2014 without evidence for independent evaluation. Multiple laboratories reported the variant with conflicting assessments, with 7 reporting it as a risk factor. Taken together, this polymorphic variant is associated with a modestly increased risk for CRC in the Ashkenazi Jewish population, but is not associated with FAP or AFAP. Based on the evidence outlined above, the variant was classified as VUS-possibly pathogenic.\"}"],"interpretation_date_last_evaluated":"2019-08-27","variation_id":"822","id":"SCV000694042","clinical_assertion_trait_set_id":"SCV000694042","submission_names":["SUB6341163"],"variation_archive_id":"VCV000000822","content":"{\"AttributeSet\":{\"Attribute\":{\"$\":\"LabCorp Variant Classification Summary - May 2015\",\"@Type\":\"AssertionMethod\"},\"Citation\":{\"URL\":{\"$\":\"https://submit.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ft/byid/pttb9itm/labcorp_variant_classification_method_-_may_2015.pdf\"}}},\"Interpretation\":{\"Citation\":[{\"ID\":{\"$\":\"18343606\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"}},{\"ID\":{\"$\":\"9751605\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"}},{\"ID\":{\"$\":\"9288102\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"}},{\"ID\":{\"$\":\"23576677\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"}},{\"ID\":{\"$\":\"9973276\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"}},{\"ID\":{\"$\":\"26845104\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"}},{\"ID\":{\"$\":\"26300997\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"}},{\"ID\":{\"$\":\"26394139\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"}},{\"ID\":{\"$\":\"26421687\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"}},{\"ID\":{\"$\":\"24416237\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"}},{\"ID\":{\"$\":\"27153395\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"}},{\"ID\":{\"$\":\"27978560\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"}},{\"ID\":{\"$\":\"14633595\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"}},{\"ID\":{\"$\":\"28135145\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"}},{\"ID\":{\"$\":\"28050010\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"}},{\"ID\":{\"$\":\"25604157\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"}},{\"ID\":{\"$\":\"10679643\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"}},{\"ID\":{\"$\":\"15929773\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"}},{\"ID\":{\"$\":\"11207040\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"}},{\"ID\":{\"$\":\"28749474\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"}},{\"ID\":{\"$\":\"30152102\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"}},{\"ID\":{\"$\":\"30426508\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"}},{\"ID\":{\"$\":\"26187149\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"}},{\"ID\":{\"$\":\"29961768\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"}}]}}","clinical_assertion_observation_ids":["SCV000694042.0"],"local_key":"NM_000038.5:c.3920T\u003eA|MedGen:CN169374","assertion_type":"variation to disease","submitter_id":"500026","interpretation_description":"Uncertain significance","review_status":"criteria provided, single submitter","internal_id":"1360394","trait_set_id":"9590","date_last_updated":"2019-11-11","submitted_assembly":"GRCh37"}

Thus any internal case data may overlap with the internal case data of other labs. The interpretation reviewed below is that of the Stanford Center for Inherited Cardiovascular Disease. MYBPC3 p.Arg502Trp This variant has been reported in at least 37 cases of HCM, with strong segregation data. Richard et al (2003) reported this variant in one individual with HCM in their French cohort. Van Driest et al (2004) observed this variant in an HCM patient who also carried p.Gly5Arg in MYBPC3. Details regarding phase and the severity of phenotype were not reported for this patient However, a comparison of the 10 patients, including this one, with multiple variants to the patients with a single variant revealed that the multiple variant group had, on average, a more severe phenotype. Ingles et al (2005) reported observing this variant in one case of HCM. Saltzman et al (2010) reported p.Arg502Trp in 34 of 1414 (2.4%) unrelated cases of HCM, making it the most common variant in that cohort. Four families had another sarcomere variant and individuals with multiple variants were more likely to have severe clinical outcomes. They noted that ~50% of carriers of p.Arg502Trp had overt disease by age 45. They reported a combined Lod score of 4.04 and noted that the likelihood that the observed cosegregation happened by chance was 1/11,000. The highest number of family members cosegregating HCM and the variant in one individual family was three. Note that this paper includes a pedigree reported online by the Seidman group (pedigree FU). Morita et al (2008) observed the variant in two unrelated children with HCM. In one of those cases and affected parent also had the variant. One of these children also carried p.Ser858Asn in MYBPC3 (phase not reported) Note that these families may have been included in the subsequent report by Saltzman et al. Liu et al (2006) reported a Chinese patient with HCM who carried both p.Arg502Trp and IVS27+12C\u003eT, also in MYBPC3. The arginine at codon 502 is highly conserved across species. This mutation results in a non-conservative amino acid change of a positively charged Arginine residue with a non-polar Tryptophan. In silico analysis with PolyPhen-2 predicts the variant to be probably damaging. Another variant at the same codon has been reported in association with HCM (p.Arg502Gln, which we consider very likely disease causing), as have variants in nearby codons (p.Arg495Gln, p.Lys505del, p.Gly507Arg). In total the variant has not been seen in ~395 published controls, including 100 (Richard et al 2003), 200 (van Driest et al 2004), 95 (Saltzman et al 2010). The variant was observed in 1 of 3472 Caucasians and 0 of 1826 African Americans in the NHLBI Exome Sequence Project dataset (as of 7/8/2014). Individual phenotypes from that dataset are not available. Several different cohorts from studies on common complex cardiovascular disease were pooled to create that sample. There is no variant at codon 502 listed in dbSNP or 1000 genomes (as of 7/8/2014).\",\"type\":\"public\"}"],"interpretation_date_last_evaluated":"2014-07-08","variation_id":"42540","id":"SCV000280214","clinical_assertion_trait_set_id":"SCV000280214","submission_names":["5_6_2016"],"variation_archive_id":"VCV000042540","clinical_assertion_observation_ids":["SCV000280214.0"],"local_key":"NM_000256.3:c.1504C\u003eT|Not provided","assertion_type":"variation to disease","submitter_id":"505443","interpretation_description":"Pathogenic","review_status":"no assertion criteria provided","internal_id":"528700","trait_set_id":"9460","date_last_updated":"2019-12-16","submitted_assembly":"GRCh37"}
