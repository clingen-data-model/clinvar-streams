Computational prediction tool is inconclusive regarding the impact of this variant on protein structure and function (internally defined REVEL score threshold 0.5 \u003c inconclusive \u003c 0.7, PMID: 27666373). Computational splicing tools suggest that this variant may not impact RNA splicing. An experimental functional study has shown that this variant causes loss of function with no evidence of the transcript or protein degradation and may alter kinetics of cardiac muscle contraction and relaxation (PMID: 30554920). This variant is known to be the most common and recurrent pathogenic mutation in a diverse, primarily European descent, cohort of individuals affected with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, occurring in 2.4% (34/1414) of patients (PMID: 20378854). This variant has been shown to segregate with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in over 25 families (PMID: 20378854, 22267749). This variant is thought to cause an estimated 340-fold increased risk for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy by 45 years of age, when more than 50% of carriers have overt disease (PMID: 20378854). This variant has also been reported in multiple unrelated affected individuals, including children with severe phenotype (PMID: 12707239, 22555271, 23054336, 23396983, 23711808). This variant has been identified in 13/280632 chromosomes (10/128434 Non-Finnish European chromosomes) in the general population by the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD). A different missense variant occurring at this codon, p.Arg502Gln, is pathogenic (Clinvar variation ID 42540), suggesting that the Arg502 residue is important for the MYBPC3 protein function. Based on available evidence, this variant is classified as Pathogenic.\"}}","version":"1","interpretation_description":"Pathogenic","clinical_assertion_observation_ids":["SCV001357620.0"],"clinical_assertion_trait_set_id":"SCV001357620","submission_id":"505849.2020-05-19","rcv_accession_id":"RCV001171137","internal_id":"2665935","date_created":"2020-06-19","submitter_id":"505849","submitted_assembly":"GRCh37","variation_id":"42540"}
