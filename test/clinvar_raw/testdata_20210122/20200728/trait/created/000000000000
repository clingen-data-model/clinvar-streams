Signs and symptoms can begin anytime from early childhood to adulthood. The severity of the disorder also varies, even among affected individuals in the same family.Inflammation is a normal immune system response to injury and foreign invaders (such as bacteria). However, ADA2 deficiency causes abnormal, unprovoked inflammation that can damage the body's tissues and organs, particularly blood vessels. (Inflammation of blood vessels is known as vasculitis.) Other tissues affected by abnormal inflammation can include the skin, gastrointestinal system, liver, kidneys, and nervous system. Depending on the severity and location of the inflammation, the disorder can cause disability or be life-threatening.Signs and symptoms that can occur with ADA2 deficiency include fevers that are intermittent, meaning they come and go; areas of net-like, mottled skin discoloration called livedo racemosa; an enlarged liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly); and recurrent strokes affecting structures deep in the brain that can start in the first few years of life. In some people, ADA2 deficiency causes additional immune system abnormalities that increase the risk of bacterial and viral infections.ADA2 deficiency is sometimes described as a form of polyarteritis nodosa (PAN), a disorder that causes inflammation of blood vessels throughout the body (systemic vasculitis). However, not all researchers classify ADA2 deficiency as a type of PAN.","type":"Disease","xrefs":["{\"db\":\"MONDO\",\"id\":\"MONDO:0019170\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"767\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"767\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"Küssmaul-Maier disease\"}","{\"db\":\"Office of Rare Diseases\",\"id\":\"7360\",\"ref_field\":\"gard_id\"}","{\"db\":\"SNOMED CT\",\"id\":\"155441006\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"adenosine-deaminase-2-deficiency\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}"],"name":"Polyarteritis nodosa","medgen_id":"C0031036","id":"38479"}

The primary feature of this condition is a blood disorder called megaloblastic anemia. In this form of anemia, which is a disorder characterized by the shortage of red blood cells, the red cells that are present are abnormally large. About half of people with Imerslund-Gräsbeck syndrome also have high levels of protein in their urine (proteinuria). Although proteinuria can be an indication of kidney problems, people with Imerslund-Gräsbeck syndrome appear to have normal kidney function.Imerslund-Gräsbeck syndrome typically begins in infancy or early childhood. The blood abnormality leads to many of the signs and symptoms of the condition, including an inability to grow and gain weight at the expected rate (failure to thrive), pale skin (pallor), excessive tiredness (fatigue), and recurring gastrointestinal or respiratory infections. Other features of Imerslund-Gräsbeck syndrome include mild neurological problems, such as weak muscle tone (hypotonia), numbness or tingling in the hands or feet, movement problems, delayed development, or confusion. Rarely, affected individuals have abnormalities of organs or tissues that make up the urinary tract, such as the bladder or the tubes that carry fluid from the kidneys to the bladder (the ureters).","type":"Disease","xrefs":["{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"618882\",\"type\":\"MIM\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"605799.0001\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"IMERSLUND-GRASBECK SYNDROME 2\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"605799.0002\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"IMERSLUND-GRASBECK SYNDROME 2\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"605799.0003\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"IMERSLUND-GRASBECK SYNDROME 2\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"605799.0004\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"IMERSLUND-GRASBECK SYNDROME 2\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"605799.0005\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"IMERSLUND-GRASBECK SYNDROME 2\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"605799.0006\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"IMERSLUND-GRASBECK SYNDROME 2\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"605799.0007\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"IMERSLUND-GRASBECK SYNDROME 2\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"618882\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"IMERSLUND-GRASBECK SYNDROME 2\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"618882\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"MEGALOBLASTIC ANEMIA, NORWEGIAN TYPE\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"imerslund-grasbeck-syndrome\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"618882\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"symbol\"}"],"name":"Imerslund-Gräsbeck syndrome 2","medgen_id":"C4016948","id":"10095"}

The most common feature of Turner syndrome is short stature, which becomes evident by about age 5. An early loss of ovarian function (ovarian hypofunction or premature ovarian failure) is also very common. The ovaries develop normally at first, but egg cells (oocytes) usually die prematurely and most ovarian tissue degenerates before birth. Many affected girls do not undergo puberty unless they receive hormone therapy, and most are unable to conceive (infertile). A small percentage of females with Turner syndrome retain normal ovarian function through young adulthood.About 30 percent of females with Turner syndrome have extra folds of skin on the neck (webbed neck), a low hairline at the back of the neck, puffiness or swelling (lymphedema) of the hands and feet, skeletal abnormalities, or kidney problems. One third to one half of individuals with Turner syndrome are born with a heart defect, such as a narrowing of the large artery leaving the heart (coarctation of the aorta) or abnormalities of the valve that connects the aorta with the heart (the aortic valve). Complications associated with these heart defects can be life-threatening.Most girls and women with Turner syndrome have normal intelligence. Developmental delays, nonverbal learning disabilities, and behavioral problems are possible, although these characteristics vary among affected individuals.","type":"Disease","xrefs":["{\"db\":\"MONDO\",\"id\":\"MONDO:0019499\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"881\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Alliance\",\"id\":\"Turner+syndrome/7268\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"turner-syndrome\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"SNOMED CT\",\"id\":\"38804009\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"turner-syndrome\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}"],"name":"Turner syndrome","medgen_id":"C0041408","id":"6538"}
