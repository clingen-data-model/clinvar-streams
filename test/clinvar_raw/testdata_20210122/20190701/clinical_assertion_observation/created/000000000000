Tumors with the wildtype allele at codon 1307 had a variety of somatic mutations that were distributed randomly in the APC gene and were not tightly clustered around the 1307 codon.

(1998), showed that mutations arising in association with the mutant allele appeared to be localized to a 29-bp region around the gene and were almost always insertions. Furthermore, these unusual somatic mutations were restricted to the mutant allele, never occurring in the wildtype allele in the same patients.

Tumors with the wildtype allele at codon 1307 had a variety of somatic mutations that were distributed randomly in the APC gene and were not tightly clustered around the 1307 codon.

Furthermore, these unusual somatic mutations were restricted to the mutant allele, never occurring in the wildtype allele in the same patients.
