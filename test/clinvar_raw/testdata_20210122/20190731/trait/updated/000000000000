{"alternate_symbols":[],"public_definition":"Multiple endocrine neoplasia is a group of disorders that affect the body's network of hormone-producing glands called the endocrine system. Hormones are chemical messengers that travel through the bloodstream and regulate the function of cells and tissues throughout the body. Multiple endocrine neoplasia typically involves tumors (neoplasia) in at least two endocrine glands; tumors can also develop in other organs and tissues. These growths can be noncancerous (benign) or cancerous (malignant). If the tumors become cancerous, the condition can be life-threatening.The major forms of multiple endocrine neoplasia are called type 1, type 2, and type 4. These types are distinguished by the genes involved, the types of hormones made, and the characteristic signs and symptoms.Many different types of tumors are associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia. Type 1 frequently involves tumors of the parathyroid glands, the pituitary gland, and the pancreas. Tumors in these glands can lead to the overproduction of hormones. The most common sign of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 is overactivity of the parathyroid glands (hyperparathyroidism). Hyperparathyroidism disrupts the normal balance of calcium in the blood, which can lead to kidney stones, thinning of bones, nausea and vomiting, high blood pressure (hypertension), weakness, and fatigue.The most common sign of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 is a form of thyroid cancer called medullary thyroid carcinoma. Some people with this disorder also develop a pheochromocytoma, which is an adrenal gland tumor that can cause dangerously high blood pressure. Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 is divided into three subtypes: type 2A, type 2B (formerly called type 3), and familial medullary thyroid carcinoma (FMTC). These subtypes differ in their characteristic signs and symptoms and risk of specific tumors; for example, hyperparathyroidism occurs only in type 2A, and medullary thyroid carcinoma is the only feature of FMTC. The signs and symptoms of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 are relatively consistent within any one family.Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 4 appears to have signs and symptoms similar to those of type 1, although it is caused by mutations in a different gene. Hyperparathyroidism is the most common feature, followed by tumors of the pituitary gland, additional endocrine glands, and other organs.","name":"Multiple endocrine neoplasia, type 4","medgen_id":"C1970712","type":"Disease","id":"3045","attribute_content":[],"symbol":"MEN4","keywords":["Hereditary cancer syndrome","Neoplasm"],"alternate_names":["MULTIPLE ENDOCRINE NEOPLASIA, TYPE IV"],"xrefs":["{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"610755\",\"type\":\"MIM\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"600778.0001\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"MULTIPLE ENDOCRINE NEOPLASIA, TYPE IV\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"600778.0002\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"MULTIPLE ENDOCRINE NEOPLASIA, TYPE IV\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"600778.0003\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"MULTIPLE ENDOCRINE NEOPLASIA, TYPE IV\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"600778.0004\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"MULTIPLE ENDOCRINE NEOPLASIA, TYPE IV\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"600778.0005\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"MULTIPLE ENDOCRINE NEOPLASIA, TYPE IV\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"600778.0006\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"MULTIPLE ENDOCRINE NEOPLASIA, TYPE IV\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"610755\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"MULTIPLE ENDOCRINE NEOPLASIA, TYPE IV\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Alliance\",\"id\":\"Multiple+endocrine+neoplasia%2C+type+4/8918\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"multiple-endocrine-neoplasia\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"610755\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"symbol\"}"]}

{"alternate_symbols":[],"public_definition":"Atopic dermatitis (also known as atopic eczema) is a disorder characterized by inflammation of the skin (dermatitis). The condition usually begins in early infancy, and it often disappears before adolescence. However, in some affected individuals the condition continues into adulthood; in others, it does not begin until adulthood. Hallmarks of atopic dermatitis include dry, itchy skin and red rashes that come and go. The rashes can occur on any part of the body, although the pattern tends to be different at different ages. In affected infants, the rashes commonly occur on the face, scalp, hands, and feet. In children, the rashes are usually found in the bend of the elbows and knees and on the front of the neck. In adolescents and adults, the rashes typically occur on the wrists, ankles, and eyelids in addition to the bend of the elbows and knees. Scratching the itchy skin can lead to oozing and crusting of the rashes and thickening and hardening (lichenification) of the skin. The itchiness can be so severe as to disturb sleep and impair a person's quality of life.The word \"atopic\" indicates an association with allergies. While atopic dermatitis is not always due to an allergic reaction, it is commonly associated with other allergic disorders: up to 60 percent of people with atopic dermatitis develop asthma or hay fever (allergic rhinitis) later in life, and up to 30 percent have food allergies. Atopic dermatitis is often the beginning of a series of allergic disorders, referred to as the \"atopic march.\" Development of these disorders typically follows a pattern, beginning with atopic dermatitis, followed by food allergies, then hay fever, and finally asthma. However, not all individuals with atopic dermatitis will progress through the atopic march, and not all individuals with one allergic disease will develop others.Individuals with atopic dermatitis have an increased risk of developing other conditions related to inflammation, such as inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and hair loss caused by a malfunctioning immune reaction (alopecia areata). They also have an increased risk of having a behavioral or psychiatric disorder, such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or depression.In a particular subset of individuals with atopic dermatitis, the immune system is unable to protect the body from foreign invaders such as bacteria and fungi (which is known as immunodeficiency). These individuals are prone to recurrent infections. Most also have other allergic disorders, such as asthma, hay fever, and food allergies.Atopic dermatitis can also be a feature of separate disorders that have a number of signs and symptoms, which can include skin abnormalities and immunodeficiency. Some such disorders are Netherton syndrome; immune dysregulation, polyendocrinopathy, enteropathy, X-linked (IPEX) syndrome; and severe dermatitis, multiple allergies, metabolic wasting (SAM) syndrome.","name":"Dermatitis, atopic, 2","medgen_id":"C1853965","type":"Disease","id":"1084","attribute_content":[],"symbol":"ATOD2","keywords":[],"alternate_names":[],"xrefs":["{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"605803\",\"type\":\"MIM\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Alliance\",\"id\":\"Dermatitis%2C+atopic%2C+2/8210\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"atopic-dermatitis\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"605803\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"symbol\"}"]}

{"alternate_symbols":[],"public_definition":"Nearsightedness, also known as myopia, is an eye condition that causes blurry distance vision. People who are nearsighted have more trouble seeing things that are far away (such as when driving) than things that are close up (such as when reading or using a computer). If it is not treated with corrective lenses or surgery, nearsightedness can lead to squinting, eyestrain, headaches, and significant visual impairment.Nearsightedness usually begins in childhood or adolescence. It tends to worsen with age until adulthood, when it may stop getting worse (stabilize). In some people, nearsightedness improves in later adulthood.For normal vision, light passes through the clear cornea at the front of the eye and is focused by the lens onto the surface of the retina, which is the lining of the back of the eye that contains light-sensing cells. People who are nearsighted typically have eyeballs that are too long from front to back. As a result, light entering the eye is focused too far forward, in front of the retina instead of on its surface. It is this change that causes distant objects to appear blurry. The longer the eyeball is, the farther forward light rays will be focused and the more severely nearsighted a person will be.Nearsightedness is measured by how powerful a lens must be to correct it. The standard unit of lens power is called a diopter. Negative (minus) powered lenses are used to correct nearsightedness. The more severe a person's nearsightedness, the larger the number of diopters required for correction. In an individual with nearsightedness, one eye may be more nearsighted than the other.Eye doctors often refer to nearsightedness less than -5 or -6 diopters as \"common myopia.\" Nearsightedness of -6 diopters or more is commonly called \"high myopia.\" This distinction is important because high myopia increases a person's risk of developing other eye problems that can lead to permanent vision loss or blindness. These problems include tearing and detachment of the retina, clouding of the lens (cataract), and an eye disease called glaucoma that is usually related to increased pressure within the eye. The risk of these other eye problems increases with the severity of the nearsightedness. The term \"pathological myopia\" is used to describe cases in which high myopia leads to tissue damage within the eye.","name":"Myopia","medgen_id":"C0027092","type":"Disease","id":"18121","attribute_content":[],"keywords":[],"alternate_names":["Close sighted","Near sighted","Near sightedness","Nearsightedness"],"xrefs":["{\"db\":\"Human Phenotype Ontology\",\"id\":\"HP:0000545\",\"type\":\"primary\"}","{\"db\":\"Human Phenotype Ontology\",\"id\":\"HP:0001110\",\"type\":\"secondary\"}","{\"db\":\"Human Phenotype Ontology\",\"id\":\"HP:0007847\",\"type\":\"secondary\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"PS160700\",\"type\":\"Phenotypic series\"}","{\"db\":\"Human Phenotype Ontology\",\"id\":\"HP:0000545\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"Close sighted\"}","{\"db\":\"Human Phenotype Ontology\",\"id\":\"HP:0000545\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"Near sighted\"}","{\"db\":\"Human Phenotype Ontology\",\"id\":\"HP:0000545\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"Near sightedness\"}","{\"db\":\"Human Phenotype Ontology\",\"id\":\"HP:0000545\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"Nearsightedness\"}","{\"db\":\"Human Phenotype Ontology\",\"id\":\"HP:0000545\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"nearsightedness\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}"]}

Expressive language skills (vocabulary and the production of speech) are particularly affected; children with this condition usually do not speak their first word, a milestone typically achieved within the first year, until age two or later, and some never learn to talk. Development of motor skills, such as crawling and walking, can also be delayed.Other signs and symptoms of Xia-Gibbs syndrome vary among affected individuals. Additional neurological features include poor coordination and balance (ataxia) and seizures. Feeding problems and sleep abnormalities can also occur in people with the condition, and many affected individuals experience short pauses in breathing while they sleep (obstructive sleep apnea). In some people with Xia-Gibbs syndrome, imaging tests of the brain show abnormalities in the brain's structure. For example, the tissue connecting the left and right halves of the brain (the corpus callosum) can be abnormally thin.Xia-Gibbs syndrome can also affect physical development. Growth is usually impaired, and many affected individuals are shorter than their peers. Side-to-side curvature of the spine (scoliosis) is also a common feature. Some people with Xia-Gibbs syndrome have unusual facial features, such as a broad forehead, low-set ears or ears that stick out, widely space eyes (hypertelorism), eye openings that slant up or down (upslanting palpebral fissures or downslanting palpebral fissures), a flat bridge of the nose, or a thin upper lip. Other, less-common abnormalities involving the bones and skin include premature fusion of certain skull bones (craniosynostosis), unusually loose (lax) joints, and loose skin.Behavior problems can also occur in Xia-Gibbs syndrome. Some affected individuals have features of autism spectrum disorder, which is characterized by impaired communication and social interactions, or of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

{"alternate_symbols":[],"public_definition":"Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a behavioral disorder that typically begins in childhood and is characterized by a short attention span (inattention), an inability to be calm and stay still (hyperactivity), and poor impulse control (impulsivity). Some people with ADHD have problems with only inattention or with hyperactivity and impulsivity, but most have problems related to all three features.In people with ADHD, the characteristic behaviors are frequent and severe enough to interfere with the activities of daily living such as school, work, and relationships with others. Because of an inability to stay focused on tasks, people with inattention may be easily distracted, forgetful, avoid tasks that require sustained attention, have difficulty organizing tasks, or frequently lose items.Hyperactivity is usually shown by frequent movement. Individuals with this feature often fidget or tap their foot when seated, leave their seat when it is inappropriate to do so (such as in the classroom), or talk a lot and interrupt others.Impulsivity can result in hasty actions without thought for the consequences. Individuals with poor impulse control may have difficulty waiting for their turn, deferring to others, or considering their actions before acting.More than two-thirds of all individuals with ADHD have additional conditions, including insomnia, mood or anxiety disorders, learning disorders, or substance use disorders. Affected individuals may also have autism spectrum disorder, which is characterized by impaired communication and social interaction, or Tourette syndrome, which is a disorder characterized by repetitive and involuntary movements or noises called tics.In most affected individuals, ADHD continues throughout life, but in about one-third of individuals, signs and symptoms of ADHD go away by adulthood.","name":"Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder","medgen_id":"C1263846","type":"Disease","id":"33114","attribute_content":[],"symbol":"ADHD","keywords":[],"ghr_links":"attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder","alternate_names":["Attention deficit","Attention deficit disorder","Attention deficits","Childhood attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder","HYPERACTIVITY OF CHILDHOOD"],"xrefs":["{\"db\":\"Human Phenotype Ontology\",\"id\":\"HP:0001576\",\"type\":\"secondary\"}","{\"db\":\"Human Phenotype Ontology\",\"id\":\"HP:0001577\",\"type\":\"secondary\"}","{\"db\":\"Human Phenotype Ontology\",\"id\":\"HP:0006973\",\"type\":\"secondary\"}","{\"db\":\"Human Phenotype Ontology\",\"id\":\"HP:0007018\",\"type\":\"primary\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"143465\",\"type\":\"MIM\"}","{\"db\":\"Human Phenotype Ontology\",\"id\":\"HP:0007018\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"Attention deficit\"}","{\"db\":\"Human Phenotype Ontology\",\"id\":\"HP:0007018\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"Attention deficit disorder\"}","{\"db\":\"Human Phenotype Ontology\",\"id\":\"HP:0007018\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"Attention deficits\"}","{\"db\":\"Human Phenotype Ontology\",\"id\":\"HP:0007018\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"Childhood attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"143465\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"HYPERACTIVITY OF CHILDHOOD\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder\",\"ref_field\":\"ghr_links\"}","{\"db\":\"Human Phenotype Ontology\",\"id\":\"HP:0007018\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"SNOMED CT\",\"id\":\"406506008\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"143465\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"symbol\"}"]}
{"alternate_symbols":[],"public_definition":"Jacobsen syndrome is a condition caused by a loss of genetic material from chromosome 11. Because this deletion occurs at the end (terminus) of the long (q) arm of chromosome 11, Jacobsen syndrome is also known as 11q terminal deletion disorder.The signs and symptoms of Jacobsen syndrome vary considerably. Most affected individuals have delayed development, including the development of speech and motor skills (such as sitting, standing, and walking). Most also have cognitive impairment and learning difficulties. Behavioral problems have been reported, including compulsive behavior (such as shredding paper), a short attention span, and easy distractibility. Many people with Jacobsen syndrome have been diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Jacobsen syndrome is also associated with an increased likelihood of autism spectrum disorders, which are characterized by impaired communication and socialization skills.Jacobsen syndrome is also characterized by distinctive facial features. These include small and low-set ears, widely set eyes (hypertelorism) with droopy eyelids (ptosis), skin folds covering the inner corner of the eyes (epicanthal folds), a broad nasal bridge, downturned corners of the mouth, a thin upper lip, and a small lower jaw. Affected individuals often have a large head size (macrocephaly) and a skull abnormality called trigonocephaly, which gives the forehead a pointed appearance.More than 90 percent of people with Jacobsen syndrome have a bleeding disorder called Paris-Trousseau syndrome. This condition causes a lifelong risk of abnormal bleeding and easy bruising. Paris-Trousseau syndrome is a disorder of platelets, which are blood cell fragments that are necessary for blood clotting.Other features of Jacobsen syndrome can include heart defects, feeding difficulties in infancy, short stature, frequent ear and sinus infections, and skeletal abnormalities. The disorder can also affect the digestive system, kidneys, and genitalia. The life expectancy of people with Jacobsen syndrome is unknown, although affected individuals have lived into adulthood.","name":"11q partial monosomy syndrome","medgen_id":"C0795841","type":"Disease","id":"2431","attribute_content":[],"symbol":"JBS","keywords":[],"alternate_names":["Jacobsen Distal 11q Deletion Syndrome"],"xrefs":["{\"db\":\"Gene\",\"id\":\"3719\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"147791\",\"type\":\"MIM\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"2308\"}","{\"db\":\"SNOMED CT\",\"id\":\"4325000\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"jacobsen-syndrome\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"147791\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"symbol\"}","{\"db\":\"Office of Rare Diseases\",\"id\":\"307\",\"ref_field\":\"symbol\"}"]}

{"alternate_symbols":[],"public_definition":"Blau syndrome is an inflammatory disorder that primarily affects the skin, joints, and eyes. Signs and symptoms begin in childhood, usually before age 4.A form of skin inflammation called granulomatous dermatitis is typically the earliest sign of Blau syndrome. This skin condition causes a persistent rash that can be scaly or involve hard lumps (nodules) that can be felt under the skin. The rash is usually found on the torso, arms, and legs.Arthritis is another common feature of Blau syndrome. In affected individuals, arthritis is characterized by inflammation of the lining of joints (the synovium). This inflammation, known as synovitis, is associated with swelling and joint pain. Synovitis usually begins in the joints of the hands, feet, wrists, and ankles. As the condition worsens, it can involve additional joints and restrict movement by decreasing the range of motion in many joints.Most people with Blau syndrome also develop uveitis, which is swelling and inflammation of the middle layer of the eye (the uvea). The uvea includes the colored portion of the eye (the iris) and related tissues that underlie the white part of the eye (the sclera). Uveitis can cause eye irritation and pain, increased sensitivity to bright light (photophobia), and blurred vision. Other structures in the eye can also become inflamed, including the outermost protective layer of the eye (the conjunctiva), the tear glands, the specialized light-sensitive tissue that lines the back of the eye (the retina), and the nerve that carries information from the eye to the brain (the optic nerve). Inflammation of any of these structures can lead to severe vision impairment or blindness.Some individuals with Blau syndrome develop kidney disease (nephritis) due to inflammation. They may also have deposits of calcium in the kidneys (nephrocalcinosis) and often develop chronic kidney failure. Inflammation of blood vessels (vasculitis) can cause scarring and tissue death in the vessels and impedes blood flow to tissues and organs.Less commonly, Blau syndrome can affect other parts of the body, including the liver, spleen, salivary gland, brain, blood vessels, lungs, and heart. Inflammation involving these organs and tissues can impair their function and cause life-threatening complications. Rarely, affected individuals have episodes of fever or high blood pressure in the blood vessels that carry blood from the heart to the lungs (pulmonary hypertension).","name":"Sarcoidosis, early-onset","medgen_id":"C1836122","type":"Disease","id":"4368","attribute_content":[],"symbol":"EOS","keywords":[],"alternate_names":[],"xrefs":["{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"609464\",\"type\":\"MIM\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"90341\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Alliance\",\"id\":\"Sarcoidosis%2C+early-onset/9263\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"blau-syndrome\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"609464\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"symbol\"}"]}

{"alternate_symbols":[],"public_definition":"Sialidosis is a severe inherited disorder that affects many organs and tissues, including the nervous system. This disorder is divided into two types, which are distinguished by the age at which symptoms appear and the severity of features.Sialidosis type I, also referred to as cherry-red spot myoclonus syndrome, is the less severe form of this condition. People with type I develop signs and symptoms of sialidosis in their teens or twenties. Initially, affected individuals experience problems walking (gait disturbance) and/or a loss of sharp vision (reduced visual acuity). Individuals with sialidosis type I also experience muscle twitches (myoclonus), difficulty coordinating movements (ataxia), leg tremors, and seizures. The myoclonus worsens over time, causing difficulty sitting, standing, or walking. People with sialidosis type I eventually require wheelchair assistance. Affected individuals have progressive vision problems, including impaired color vision or night blindness. An eye abnormality called a cherry-red spot, which can be identified with an eye examination, is characteristic of this disorder. Sialidosis type I does not affect intelligence or life expectancy.Sialidosis type II, the more severe type of the disorder, is further divided into congenital, infantile, and juvenile forms. The features of congenital sialidosis type II can develop before birth. This form of sialidosis is associated with an abnormal buildup of fluid in the abdominal cavity (ascites) or widespread swelling before birth caused by fluid accumulation (hydrops fetalis). Affected infants may also have an enlarged liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly), abnormal bone development (dysostosis multiplex), and distinctive facial features that are often described as \"coarse.\" As a result of these serious health problems, individuals with congenital sialidosis type II usually are stillborn or die soon after birth.Infantile sialidosis type II shares some features with the congenital form, although the signs and symptoms are slightly less severe and begin within the first year of life. Features of the infantile form include hepatosplenomegaly, dysostosis multiplex, \"coarse\" facial features, short stature, and intellectual disability. As children with infantile sialidosis type II get older, they may develop myoclonus and cherry-red spots. Other signs and symptoms include hearing loss, overgrowth of the gums (gingival hyperplasia), and widely spaced teeth. Affected individuals may survive into childhood or adolescence.The juvenile form has the least severe signs and symptoms of the different forms of sialidosis type II. Features of this condition usually appear in late childhood and may include mildly \"coarse\" facial features, mild bone abnormalities, cherry-red spots, myoclonus, intellectual disability, and dark red spots on the skin (angiokeratomas). The life expectancy of individuals with juvenile sialidosis type II varies depending on the severity of symptoms.","name":"Sialidosis type I","medgen_id":"C0023806","type":"Disease","id":"9310","attribute_content":[],"keywords":[],"alternate_names":[],"xrefs":["{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"812\"}","{\"db\":\"Office of Rare Diseases\",\"id\":\"7639\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"sialidosis\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}"]}

This condition had previously been known as spinocerebellar ataxia with epilepsy (SCAE).The first symptom of MEMSA is usually cerebellar ataxia, which refers to problems with coordination and balance due to defects in the part of the brain that is involved in coordinating movement (cerebellum). Recurrent seizures (epilepsy) usually develop later, often in combination with uncontrollable muscle jerks (myoclonus). The seizures usually begin in the right arm and spread to become generalized throughout the body. Additionally, affected individuals may have severe brain dysfunction (encephalopathy) or muscle weakness (myopathy). The myopathy can affect muscles close to the center of the body (proximal), such as the muscles of the hips, thighs, upper arms, or neck, or muscles farther away from the center of the body (distal), such as the muscles of the hands or feet.

Affected children also typically have distinctive starfish-shaped patches of thickened skin on the tops of the fingers and toes or on the knees. Within a few years they develop tight bands of abnormal fibrous tissue around their fingers and toes (pseudoainhum); the bands may cut off the circulation to the digits and result in spontaneous amputation. People with the classic form of the disorder also have hearing loss.The variant form of Vohwinkel syndrome does not involve hearing loss, and the skin features also include widespread dry, scaly skin (ichthyosis), especially on the limbs. The ichthyosis is usually mild, and there may also be mild reddening of the skin (erythroderma).

Affected children often initially have delayed speech and behavior problems. They may become restless, destructive, anxious, or aggressive, and some display features of autism spectrum disorder, which is a condition characterized by difficulty with social interactions and communication. Sleep disturbances are also very common in children with MPS III. This condition causes progressive intellectual disability and the loss of previously acquired skills (developmental regression). In later stages of the disorder, people with MPS III may develop seizures and movement disorders.The physical features of MPS III are less pronounced than those of other types of mucopolysaccharidosis. Individuals with MPS III typically have mildly \"coarse\" facial features, a large head (macrocephaly), a slightly enlarged liver (mild hepatomegaly), and a soft out-pouching around the belly-button (umbilical hernia) or lower abdomen (inguinal hernia). Some people with MPS III have short stature, joint stiffness, or mild dysostosis multiplex, which refers to multiple skeletal abnormalities seen on x-ray. Affected individuals often experience chronic diarrhea and recurrent upper respiratory and ear infections.

The muscle weakness slowly worsens over time and can lead to delayed development of motor skills, such as crawling or walking; muscle pain during exercise; and difficulty walking. Some affected individuals may need wheelchair assistance as the muscles atrophy and weakness becomes more severe. In rare instances, the muscle weakness improves over time.Some people with centronuclear myopathy experience mild to severe breathing problems related to the weakness of muscles needed for breathing. People with centronuclear myopathy may have droopy eyelids (ptosis) and weakness in other facial muscles, including the muscles that control eye movement. People with this condition may also have foot abnormalities, a high arch in the roof of the mouth (high-arched palate), and abnormal side-to-side curvature of the spine (scoliosis). Rarely, individuals with centronuclear myopathy have a weakened heart muscle (cardiomyopathy), disturbances in nerve function (neuropathy), or intellectual disability.A key feature of centronuclear myopathy is the displacement of the nucleus in muscle cells, which can be viewed under a microscope. Normally the nucleus is found at the edges of the rod-shaped muscle cells, but in people with centronuclear myopathy the nucleus is located in the center of these cells.

{"alternate_symbols":["CMT2I","CMT2J","DI-CMTD"],"public_definition":"Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease encompasses a group of disorders called hereditary sensory and motor neuropathies that damage the peripheral nerves. Peripheral nerves connect the brain and spinal cord to muscles and to sensory cells that detect sensations such as touch, pain, heat, and sound. Damage to the peripheral nerves that worsens over time can result in alteration or loss of sensation and wasting (atrophy) of muscles in the feet, legs, and hands.Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease usually becomes apparent in adolescence or early adulthood, but onset may occur anytime from early childhood through late adulthood. Symptoms of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease vary in severity and age of onset even among members of the same family. Some people never realize they have the disorder because their symptoms are so mild, but most have a moderate amount of physical disability. A small percentage of people experience severe weakness or other problems which, in very rare cases, can be life-threatening. In most affected individuals, however, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease does not affect life expectancy.Typically, the earliest symptoms of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease result from muscle atrophy in the feet. Affected individuals may have foot abnormalities such as high arches (pes cavus), flat feet (pes planus), or curled toes (hammer toes). They often have difficulty flexing the foot or walking on the heel of the foot. These difficulties may cause a higher than normal step (steppage gait) and increase the risk of ankle injuries and tripping. As the disease worsens, muscles in the lower legs usually weaken, but leg and foot problems rarely require the use of a wheelchair.Affected individuals may also develop weakness in the hands, causing difficulty with daily activities such as writing, fastening buttons, and turning doorknobs. People with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease typically experience a decreased sensitivity to touch, heat, and cold in the feet and lower legs, but occasionally feel aching or burning sensations. In rare cases, affected individuals have loss of vision or gradual hearing loss that sometimes leads to deafness.There are several types of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, which are differentiated by their effects on nerve cells and patterns of inheritance. Type 1 (CMT1) is characterized by abnormalities in myelin, the fatty substance that covers nerve cells, protecting them and helping to transmit nerve impulses. These abnormalities slow the transmission of nerve impulses and can affect the health of the nerve fiber. Type 2 (CMT2) is characterized by abnormalities in the fiber, or axon, that extends from a nerve cell body to muscles or to sense organs. These abnormalities reduce the strength of the nerve impulse. In forms of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease classified as intermediate type, the nerve impulses are both slowed and reduced in strength, probably due to abnormalities in both myelin and axons. Type 4 (CMT4) is distinguished from the other types by its pattern of inheritance; it can affect either the axons or the myelin. Type X Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMTX) is caused by mutations in genes on the X chromosome, one of the two sex chromosomes. Within the various types of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, subtypes (such as CMT1A, CMT1B, CMT2A, CMT4A, and CMTX1) indicate different genetic causes.Sometimes other, historical names are used to refer to particular forms of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. For example, Roussy-Levy syndrome is a form of CMT11 with the additional feature of rhythmic shaking (tremors). Dejerine-Sottas syndrome is a term sometimes used to describe a severe, early childhood form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease; it is also sometimes called type 3 (CMT3). Depending on the specific gene that is altered, this severe, early-onset form of the disorder may also be classified as CMT1 or CMT4. CMTX5 is also known as Rosenberg-Chutorian syndrome.","name":"Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease dominant intermediate 3","medgen_id":"C1843075","type":"Disease","id":"1419","attribute_content":[],"symbol":"CMTDID","keywords":[],"alternate_names":["CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH DISEASE, DOMINANT INTERMEDIATE D","CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH NEUROPATHY, DOMINANT INTERMEDIATE D"],"xrefs":["{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"607791\",\"type\":\"MIM\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"159440.0018\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH DISEASE, DOMINANT INTERMEDIATE D\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"607791\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH DISEASE, DOMINANT INTERMEDIATE D\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"607791\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH NEUROPATHY, DOMINANT INTERMEDIATE D\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000247963\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_symbols\",\"ref_field_element\":\"CMT2I\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000247963\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_symbols\",\"ref_field_element\":\"CMT2J\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"607791\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_symbols\",\"ref_field_element\":\"DI-CMTD\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Alliance\",\"id\":\"Charcot-Marie-Tooth+Disease+Dominant+Intermediate+3/1280\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Office of Rare Diseases\",\"id\":\"9207\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"charcot-marie-tooth-disease\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"607791\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"symbol\"}"]}

TdP is usually self-terminating, thus causing a syncopal event, the most common symptom in individuals with LQTS. Such cardiac events typically occur during exercise and emotional stress, less frequently during sleep, and usually without warning. In some instances, TdP degenerates to ventricular fibrillation and causes aborted cardiac arrest (if the individual is defibrillated) or sudden death. Approximately 50% of untreated individuals with a pathogenic variant in one of the genes associated with LQTS have symptoms, usually one to a few syncopal events. While cardiac events may occur from infancy through middle age, they are most common from the preteen years through the 20s. Some types of LQTS are associated with a phenotype extending beyond cardiac arrhythmia. In addition to the prolonged QT interval, associations include muscle weakness and facial dysmorphism in Andersen-Tawil syndrome (LQTS type 7); hand/foot, facial, and neurodevelopmental features in Timothy syndrome (LQTS type 8); and profound sensorineural hearing loss in Jervell and Lange-Nielson syndrome.","name":"Long QT syndrome 9","medgen_id":"C2678485","type":"Disease","id":"2567","attribute_content":[],"symbol":"LQT9","keywords":[],"alternate_names":["LONG QT SYNDROME 2/9, DIGENIC","LONG QT SYNDROME 9, ACQUIRED, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO"],"content":"{\"Citation\":[{\"@Abbrev\":\"GeneReviews\",\"@Type\":\"review\",\"ID\":[{\"$\":\"20301308\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"},{\"$\":\"NBK1129\",\"@Source\":\"BookShelf\"}]},{\"@Abbrev\":\"GeneReviews\",\"@Type\":\"review\",\"ID\":[{\"$\":\"20301559\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"},{\"$\":\"NBK1385\",\"@Source\":\"BookShelf\"}]}]}","xrefs":["{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"611818\",\"type\":\"MIM\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"101016\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"768\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"611818\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"LONG QT SYNDROME 2/9, DIGENIC\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"611818\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"LONG QT SYNDROME 9, ACQUIRED, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"611818\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_symbols\",\"ref_field_element\":\"LQT2/9, DIGENIC\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Alliance\",\"id\":\"Long+QT+syndrome+9/4306\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Office of Rare Diseases\",\"id\":\"10435\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"GeneReviews\",\"id\":\"NBK1129\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"611818\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"symbol\"}","{\"db\":\"Office of Rare Diseases\",\"id\":\"10435\",\"ref_field\":\"symbol\"}"]}

Affected individuals typically present with either asymmetric focal weakness of the extremities (stumbling or poor handgrip) or bulbar findings (dysarthria, dysphagia). Other findings may include muscle fasciculations, muscle cramps, and labile affect, but not necessarily mood. Regardless of initial symptoms, atrophy and weakness eventually affect other muscles. The mean age of onset is 56 years in individuals with no known family history and 46 years in individuals with more than one affected family member (familial ALS or FALS). Average disease duration is about three years, but it can vary significantly.

{"alternate_symbols":[],"public_definition":"1q21.1 microduplication is a chromosomal change in which a small amount of genetic material on chromosome 1 is abnormally copied (duplicated). The duplication occurs on the long (q) arm of the chromosome at a location designated q21.1.Some people with a 1q21.1 microduplication have developmental delay and intellectual disability that is typically mild to moderate. Individuals with this condition can also have features of autism spectrum disorder. These disorders are characterized by impaired communication and socialization skills, as well as delayed development of speech and language. Expressive language skills (vocabulary and the production of speech) tend to be more impaired than receptive language skills (the ability to understand speech) in affected individuals. In childhood, 1q21.1 microduplications may also be associated with an increased risk of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and other behavioral problems. Psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia or mood disorders such as anxiety or depression occur in some affected individuals, usually during adulthood. Rarely, recurrent seizures (epilepsy) occur in people with a 1q21.1 microduplication.Some individuals with a 1q21.1 microduplication are born with malformations of the heart, including a particular combination of heart defects known as tetralogy of Fallot. Less commonly, other physical malformations such as the urethra opening on the underside of the penis (hypospadias) in males, inward- and upward-turning feet (clubfeet), or misalignment of the hip joint (hip dysplasia) are present at birth. Individuals with a 1q21.1 microduplication may also have a larger than average head size or taller than average adult stature. Some have slightly unusual facial features such as wide-set eyes or low-set ears. As adults, individuals with a 1q21.1 microduplication may be prone to develop cysts, swollen and knotted (varicose) veins, or carpal tunnel syndrome, which is characterized by numbness, tingling, and weakness in the hands and fingers.

{"alternate_symbols":["CMT 2K"],"public_definition":"Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease encompasses a group of disorders called hereditary sensory and motor neuropathies that damage the peripheral nerves. Peripheral nerves connect the brain and spinal cord to muscles and to sensory cells that detect sensations such as touch, pain, heat, and sound. Damage to the peripheral nerves that worsens over time can result in alteration or loss of sensation and wasting (atrophy) of muscles in the feet, legs, and hands.Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease usually becomes apparent in adolescence or early adulthood, but onset may occur anytime from early childhood through late adulthood. Symptoms of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease vary in severity and age of onset even among members of the same family. Some people never realize they have the disorder because their symptoms are so mild, but most have a moderate amount of physical disability. A small percentage of people experience severe weakness or other problems which, in very rare cases, can be life-threatening. In most affected individuals, however, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease does not affect life expectancy.Typically, the earliest symptoms of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease result from muscle atrophy in the feet. Affected individuals may have foot abnormalities such as high arches (pes cavus), flat feet (pes planus), or curled toes (hammer toes). They often have difficulty flexing the foot or walking on the heel of the foot. These difficulties may cause a higher than normal step (steppage gait) and increase the risk of ankle injuries and tripping. As the disease worsens, muscles in the lower legs usually weaken, but leg and foot problems rarely require the use of a wheelchair.Affected individuals may also develop weakness in the hands, causing difficulty with daily activities such as writing, fastening buttons, and turning doorknobs. People with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease typically experience a decreased sensitivity to touch, heat, and cold in the feet and lower legs, but occasionally feel aching or burning sensations. In rare cases, affected individuals have loss of vision or gradual hearing loss that sometimes leads to deafness.There are several types of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, which are differentiated by their effects on nerve cells and patterns of inheritance. Type 1 (CMT1) is characterized by abnormalities in myelin, the fatty substance that covers nerve cells, protecting them and helping to transmit nerve impulses. These abnormalities slow the transmission of nerve impulses and can affect the health of the nerve fiber. Type 2 (CMT2) is characterized by abnormalities in the fiber, or axon, that extends from a nerve cell body to muscles or to sense organs. These abnormalities reduce the strength of the nerve impulse. In forms of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease classified as intermediate type, the nerve impulses are both slowed and reduced in strength, probably due to abnormalities in both myelin and axons. Type 4 (CMT4) is distinguished from the other types by its pattern of inheritance; it can affect either the axons or the myelin. Type X Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMTX) is caused by mutations in genes on the X chromosome, one of the two sex chromosomes. Within the various types of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, subtypes (such as CMT1A, CMT1B, CMT2A, CMT4A, and CMTX1) indicate different genetic causes.Sometimes other, historical names are used to refer to particular forms of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. For example, Roussy-Levy syndrome is a form of CMT11 with the additional feature of rhythmic shaking (tremors). Dejerine-Sottas syndrome is a term sometimes used to describe a severe, early childhood form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease; it is also sometimes called type 3 (CMT3). Depending on the specific gene that is altered, this severe, early-onset form of the disorder may also be classified as CMT1 or CMT4. CMTX5 is also known as Rosenberg-Chutorian syndrome.","name":"Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2K","medgen_id":"C1842983","type":"Disease","id":"782","attribute_content":[],"symbol":"CMT2K","keywords":[],"alternate_names":["CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH DISEASE, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT, TYPE 2K","CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH DISEASE, AXONAL, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT, TYPE 2K","CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH NEUROPATHY, AXONAL, TYPE 2K"],"content":"{\"Citation\":[{\"@Abbrev\":\"GeneReviews\",\"@Type\":\"review\",\"ID\":[{\"$\":\"20301462\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"},{\"$\":\"NBK1285\",\"@Source\":\"BookShelf\"}]},{\"@Abbrev\":\"MDA Consensus document - CMT testing, 2011\",\"@Type\":\"general\",\"ID\":{\"$\":\"3058597\",\"@Source\":\"pmc\"}},{\"@Abbrev\":\"GeneReviews\",\"@Type\":\"review\",\"ID\":[{\"$\":\"20301532\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"},{\"$\":\"NBK1358\",\"@Source\":\"BookShelf\"}]}]}","xrefs":["{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"607831\",\"type\":\"MIM\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"101097\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"99944\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"606598.0014\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH DISEASE, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT, TYPE 2K\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"606598.0015\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH DISEASE, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT, TYPE 2K\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"606598.0017\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH DISEASE, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT, TYPE 2K\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"606598.0018\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH DISEASE, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT, TYPE 2K\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"606598.0019\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH DISEASE, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT, TYPE 2K\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"607831\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH DISEASE, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT, TYPE 2K\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"606598.0009\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH DISEASE, AXONAL, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT, TYPE 2K\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"606598.0010\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH DISEASE, AXONAL, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT, TYPE 2K\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"606598.0012\",\"type\":\"Allelic variant\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH DISEASE, AXONAL, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT, TYPE 2K\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"607831\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH NEUROPATHY, AXONAL, TYPE 2K\"}","{\"db\":\"Office of Rare Diseases\",\"id\":\"9199\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_symbols\",\"ref_field_element\":\"CMT 2K\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Alliance\",\"id\":\"Charcot-Marie-Tooth+Disease+Type+2K/1302\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Office of Rare Diseases\",\"id\":\"9199\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"charcot-marie-tooth-disease\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"607831\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"symbol\"}"]}

Severe MPS I. Infants appear normal at birth. Typical early manifestations are nonspecific (e.g., umbilical or inguinal hernia, frequent upper respiratory-tract infections before age 1 year). Coarsening of the facial features may not become apparent until after age one year. Gibbus deformity of the lower spine is common and often noted within the first year. Progressive skeletal dysplasia (dysostosis multiplex) involving all bones is universal. By age three years, linear growth decreases. Intellectual disability is progressive and profound. Hearing loss is common. Death, typically caused by cardiorespiratory failure, usually occurs within the first ten years of life. Attenuated MPS I. The severity and rate of disease progression range from serious life-threatening complications leading to death in the second to third decades to a normal life span complicated by significant disability from progressive joint manifestations and cardiorespiratory disease. While some individuals have no neurologic involvement and psychomotor development may be normal in early childhood, learning disabilities can be present.

Madelung deformity (abnormal alignment of the radius, ulna, and carpal bones at the wrist) typically develops in mid-to-late childhood and is more common and severe in females. The phenotype of short stature caused by SHOX deficiency in the absence of mesomelia and Madelung deformity (called SHOX-deficient short stature in this GeneReview) is highly variable, even within the same family.","name":"Leri Weill dyschondrosteosis","medgen_id":"C0265309","type":"Disease","id":"2677","attribute_content":[],"symbol":"LWD","keywords":[],"alternate_names":[],"content":"{\"Citation\":{\"@Abbrev\":\"GeneReviews\",\"@Type\":\"review\",\"ID\":[{\"$\":\"20301394\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"},{\"$\":\"NBK1215\",\"@Source\":\"BookShelf\"}]}}","xrefs":["{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"127300\",\"type\":\"MIM\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"240\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"127300\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_symbols\",\"ref_field_element\":\"DCO\"}","{\"db\":\"Office of Rare Diseases\",\"id\":\"3224\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_symbols\",\"ref_field_element\":\"DCO\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Alliance\",\"id\":\"Leri+Weill+dyschondrosteosis/4180\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Office of Rare Diseases\",\"id\":\"3224\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"GeneReviews\",\"id\":\"NBK1215\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"127300\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"symbol\"}","{\"db\":\"Office of Rare Diseases\",\"id\":\"3224\",\"ref_field\":\"symbol\"}"]}

The visual field defect is typically centrocecal, central, or paracentral; it is often large in those with severe disease. The color vision defect is often described as acquired blue-yellow loss (tritanopia). Other findings can include auditory neuropathy resulting in sensorineural hearing loss that ranges from severe and congenital to subclinical (i.e., identified by specific audiologic testing only). Visual evoked potentials are typically absent or delayed; pattern electroretinogram shows an abnormal N95:P50 ratio. Tritanopia is the classic feature of color vision defect, but more diffuse nonspecific dyschromatopsia is not uncommon.

The surface of the brain normally has many ridges or folds, called gyri. In people with polymicrogyria, the brain develops too many folds, and the folds are unusually small. The name of this condition literally means too many (poly-) small (micro-) folds (-gyria) in the surface of the brain.Polymicrogyria can affect part of the brain or the whole brain. When the condition affects one side of the brain, researchers describe it as unilateral. When it affects both sides of the brain, it is described as bilateral. The signs and symptoms associated with polymicrogyria depend on how much of the brain, and which particular brain regions, are affected.Researchers have identified multiple forms of polymicrogyria. The mildest form is known as unilateral focal polymicrogyria. This form of the condition affects a relatively small area on one side of the brain. It may cause minor neurological problems, such as mild seizures that can be easily controlled with medication. Some people with unilateral focal polymicrogyria do not have any problems associated with the condition.Bilateral forms of polymicrogyria tend to cause more severe neurological problems. Signs and symptoms of these conditions can include recurrent seizures (epilepsy), delayed development, crossed eyes, problems with speech and swallowing, and muscle weakness or paralysis. The most severe form of the disorder, bilateral generalized polymicrogyria, affects the entire brain. This condition causes severe intellectual disability, problems with movement, and seizures that are difficult or impossible to control with medication.Polymicrogyria most often occurs as an isolated feature, although it can occur with other brain abnormalities. It is also a feature of several genetic syndromes characterized by intellectual disability and multiple birth defects. These include 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, Adams-Oliver syndrome, Aicardi syndrome, Galloway-Mowat syndrome, Joubert syndrome, and Zellweger spectrum disorder.","name":"Polymicrogyria, bilateral temporooccipital","medgen_id":"C4013648","type":"Disease","id":"3994","attribute_content":[],"symbol":"BTOP","keywords":[],"alternate_names":[],"content":"{\"Citation\":{\"@Abbrev\":\"GeneReviews\",\"@Type\":\"review\",\"ID\":[{\"$\":\"20301504\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"},{\"$\":\"NBK1329\",\"@Source\":\"BookShelf\"}]}}","xrefs":["{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"612691\",\"type\":\"MIM\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"208441\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"polymicrogyria\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"612691\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"symbol\"}"]}

Peripheral nerves connect the brain and spinal cord to muscles and to sensory cells that detect sensations such as touch, pain, heat, and sound. Damage to the peripheral nerves that worsens over time can result in alteration or loss of sensation and wasting (atrophy) of muscles in the feet, legs, and hands.Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease usually becomes apparent in adolescence or early adulthood, but onset may occur anytime from early childhood through late adulthood. Symptoms of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease vary in severity and age of onset even among members of the same family. Some people never realize they have the disorder because their symptoms are so mild, but most have a moderate amount of physical disability. A small percentage of people experience severe weakness or other problems which, in very rare cases, can be life-threatening. In most affected individuals, however, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease does not affect life expectancy.Typically, the earliest symptoms of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease result from muscle atrophy in the feet. Affected individuals may have foot abnormalities such as high arches (pes cavus), flat feet (pes planus), or curled toes (hammer toes). They often have difficulty flexing the foot or walking on the heel of the foot. These difficulties may cause a higher than normal step (steppage gait) and increase the risk of ankle injuries and tripping. As the disease worsens, muscles in the lower legs usually weaken, but leg and foot problems rarely require the use of a wheelchair.Affected individuals may also develop weakness in the hands, causing difficulty with daily activities such as writing, fastening buttons, and turning doorknobs. People with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease typically experience a decreased sensitivity to touch, heat, and cold in the feet and lower legs, but occasionally feel aching or burning sensations. In rare cases, affected individuals have loss of vision or gradual hearing loss that sometimes leads to deafness.There are several types of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, which are differentiated by their effects on nerve cells and patterns of inheritance. Type 1 (CMT1) is characterized by abnormalities in myelin, the fatty substance that covers nerve cells, protecting them and helping to transmit nerve impulses. These abnormalities slow the transmission of nerve impulses and can affect the health of the nerve fiber. Type 2 (CMT2) is characterized by abnormalities in the fiber, or axon, that extends from a nerve cell body to muscles or to sense organs. These abnormalities reduce the strength of the nerve impulse. In forms of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease classified as intermediate type, the nerve impulses are both slowed and reduced in strength, probably due to abnormalities in both myelin and axons. Type 4 (CMT4) is distinguished from the other types by its pattern of inheritance; it can affect either the axons or the myelin. Type X Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMTX) is caused by mutations in genes on the X chromosome, one of the two sex chromosomes. Within the various types of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, subtypes (such as CMT1A, CMT1B, CMT2A, CMT4A, and CMTX1) indicate different genetic causes.Sometimes other, historical names are used to refer to particular forms of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. For example, Roussy-Levy syndrome is a form of CMT11 with the additional feature of rhythmic shaking (tremors). Dejerine-Sottas syndrome is a term sometimes used to describe a severe, early childhood form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease; it is also sometimes called type 3 (CMT3). Depending on the specific gene that is altered, this severe, early-onset form of the disorder may also be classified as CMT1 or CMT4. CMTX5 is also known as Rosenberg-Chutorian syndrome.","name":"Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, axonal, with vocal cord paresis, autosomal recessive","medgen_id":"C1843183","type":"Disease","id":"1418","attribute_content":[],"keywords":[],"alternate_names":["CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH NEUROPATHY, AXONAL, WITH VOCAL CORD PARESIS, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE","CMT2 WITH VOCAL CORD PARESIS, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE","Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4A"],"content":"{\"Citation\":{\"@Abbrev\":\"GeneReviews\",\"@Type\":\"review\",\"ID\":[{\"$\":\"20301532\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"},{\"$\":\"NBK1358\",\"@Source\":\"BookShelf\"}]}}","xrefs":["{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"607706\",\"type\":\"MIM\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"101097\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"607706\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH NEUROPATHY, AXONAL, WITH VOCAL CORD PARESIS, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"607706\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"CMT2 WITH VOCAL CORD PARESIS, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Alliance\",\"id\":\"Charcot-Marie-Tooth+disease%2C+axonal%2C+with+vocal+cord+paresis%2C+autosomal+recessive/7952\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Office of Rare Diseases\",\"id\":\"9195\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"charcot-marie-tooth-disease\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}"]}

KCNQ2-BFNE is characterized by a wide spectrum of seizure types (tonic or apneic episodes, focal clonic activity, or autonomic changes) that start in otherwise healthy infants between the second and eighth day of life and spontaneously disappear between the first and the sixth to 12th month of life. Motor activity may be confined to one body part, migrate to other body regions, or generalize. Seizures are generally brief, lasting one to two minutes. Rarely, KCNQ2-BFNE may evolve into status epilepticus. About 10%-15% of individuals with BFNE develop epileptic seizures later in life. KCNQ2-NEE is characterized by multiple daily seizures beginning in the first week of life that are mostly tonic, with associated focal motor and autonomic features. Seizures generally cease between ages nine months and four years. At onset, EEG shows a burst-suppression pattern or multifocal epileptiform activity; early brain MRI can show basal ganglia and thalamic hyperintensities that later resolve.

KCNQ2-BFNE is characterized by a wide spectrum of seizure types (tonic or apneic episodes, focal clonic activity, or autonomic changes) that start in otherwise healthy infants between the second and eighth day of life and spontaneously disappear between the first and the sixth to 12th month of life. Motor activity may be confined to one body part, migrate to other body regions, or generalize. Seizures are generally brief, lasting one to two minutes. Rarely, KCNQ2-BFNE may evolve into status epilepticus. About 10%-15% of individuals with BFNE develop epileptic seizures later in life. KCNQ2-NEE is characterized by multiple daily seizures beginning in the first week of life that are mostly tonic, with associated focal motor and autonomic features. Seizures generally cease between ages nine months and four years. At onset, EEG shows a burst-suppression pattern or multifocal epileptiform activity; early brain MRI can show basal ganglia and thalamic hyperintensities that later resolve.

{"alternate_symbols":[],"disease_mechanism_id":"273","public_definition":"Early infantile epileptic encephalopathy 1 (EIEE1) is a seizure disorder characterized by a type of seizure known as infantile spasms. The spasms usually appear before the age of 1. Several types of spasms have been described, but the most commonly reported type involves bending at the waist and neck and extending the arms and legs (sometimes called a jackknife spasm). Each spasm lasts only seconds, but they occur in clusters several minutes long. Although individuals do not usually have spasms while they are sleeping, the spasms commonly occur just after awakening. Infantile spasms usually stop by age 5, but many children then develop other types of seizures that recur throughout their lives.Most babies with EIEE1 have characteristic results on an electroencephalogram (EEG), a test used to measure the electrical activity of the brain. The EEG of these individuals typically shows an irregular pattern known as hypsarrhythmia, and this finding can help differentiate infantile spasms from other types of seizures.Because of the recurrent seizures, babies with EIEE1 stop developing normally and begin to lose skills they have acquired (developmental regression), such as sitting, rolling over, and babbling. Most affected individuals also have intellectual disability throughout their lives.","name":"West syndrome","medgen_id":"C0037769","type":"Disease","id":"18336","attribute_content":[],"symbol":"EIEE1","keywords":[],"alternate_names":["Spasms, Infantile"],"xrefs":["{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"3451\"}","{\"db\":\"MeSH\",\"id\":\"D013036\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"Spasms, Infantile\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000530022\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000530238\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000552301\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000558073\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Alliance\",\"id\":\"West+syndrome/7475\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Office of Rare Diseases\",\"id\":\"7887\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"SNOMED CT\",\"id\":\"28055006\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"early-infantile-epileptic-encephalopathy-1\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000500883\",\"ref_field\":\"symbol\"}"],"disease_mechanism":"loss of function"}

Adrenal insufficiency is acute infantile onset (average age 3 weeks) in approximately 60% of affected males and childhood onset (ages 1-9 years) in approximately 40%. HH typically manifests in a male with adrenal insufficiency as delayed puberty (i.e., onset age \u003e14 years) and less commonly as arrested puberty at about Tanner Stage 3. Rarely, X-linked AHC manifests initially in early adulthood as delayed-onset adrenal insufficiency, partial HH, and/or infertility. Heterozygous females very occasionally have manifestations of adrenal insufficiency or hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. Xp21 deletion includes deletion of NR0B1 (causing X-linked AHC) and GK (causing glycerol kinase deficiency), and in some cases deletion of DMD (causing Duchenne muscular dystrophy). Developmental delay has been reported in males with Xp21 deletion when the deletion extends proximally to include DMD or when larger deletions extend distally to include IL1RAPL1 and DMD.","name":"Congenital adrenal hypoplasia, X-linked","medgen_id":"C0342482","type":"Disease","id":"87","attribute_content":[],"symbol":"AHC","keywords":[],"alternate_names":["ADRENAL HYPOPLASIA, CONGENITAL, WITH HYPOGONADOTROPIC HYPOGONADISM","Isolated X-Linked Adrenal Hypoplasia Congenita"],"content":"{\"Citation\":{\"@Abbrev\":\"GeneReviews\",\"@Type\":\"review\",\"ID\":[{\"$\":\"20301604\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"},{\"$\":\"NBK1431\",\"@Source\":\"BookShelf\"}]}}","xrefs":["{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"300200\",\"type\":\"MIM\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"95702\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"300200\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"ADRENAL HYPOPLASIA, CONGENITAL, WITH HYPOGONADOTROPIC HYPOGONADISM\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"300200\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_symbols\",\"ref_field_element\":\"AHCH\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Alliance\",\"id\":\"Congenital+adrenal+hypoplasia%2C+X-linked/7542\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"SNOMED CT\",\"id\":\"237764004\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"GeneReviews\",\"id\":\"NBK1431\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"300200\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"symbol\"}"],"disease_mechanism":"loss of function"}

Individuals with ZSD usually come to clinical attention in the newborn period or later in childhood. Affected newborns are hypotonic and feed poorly. They have distinctive facies, congenital malformations (neuronal migration defects associated with neonatal-onset seizures, renal cysts, and bony stippling [chondrodysplasia punctata] of the patella[e] and other long bones), and liver disease that can be severe. Infants with severe ZSD are significantly impaired and typically die during the first year of life, usually having made no developmental progress. Individuals with intermediate/milder ZSD do not have congenital malformations, but rather progressive peroxisome dysfunction variably manifest as sensory loss (secondary to retinal dystrophy and sensorineural hearing loss); neurologic involvement (ataxia, polyneuropathy, and leukodystrophy); liver dysfunction; adrenal insufficiency; and renal oxalate stones. While hypotonia and developmental delays are typical, intellect can be normal.

Pulmonary disease is the major cause of morbidity and mortality in CF. Meconium ileus occurs at birth in 15%-20% of newborns with CF. More than 95% of males with CF are infertile. Congenital absence of the vas deferens (CAVD) is generally identified during evaluation of infertility or as an incidental finding at the time of a surgical procedure.

The clinical features of COL1A1/2-related OI represent a continuum ranging from perinatal lethality to individuals with severe skeletal deformities, mobility impairments, and very short stature to nearly asymptomatic individuals with a mild predisposition to fractures, normal dentition, normal stature, and normal life span. Fractures can occur in any bone, but are most common in the extremities. DI is characterized by gray or brown teeth that may appear translucent and wear down and break easily. COL1A1/2-related OI has been classified into four types (I, II, III, and IV) based on clinical presentation and radiographic findings. This classification system can be helpful in providing information about prognosis and management for a given individual. The four OI types are now referred to as follows: OI type I: classic non-deforming OI with blue sclerae. OI type II: perinatally lethal OI. OI type III: progressively deforming OI. OI type IV: common variable OI with normal sclerae.","name":"Osteogenesis imperfecta type I","medgen_id":"C0023931","type":"Disease","id":"5697","attribute_content":[],"symbol":"OI1","keywords":[],"alternate_names":["Lobstein's Disease","OI TYPE IA","OI, TYPE I"],"content":"{\"Citation\":[{\"@Abbrev\":\"GeneReviews\",\"@Type\":\"review\",\"ID\":[{\"$\":\"20301472\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"},{\"$\":\"NBK1295\",\"@Source\":\"BookShelf\"}]},{\"@Abbrev\":\"EMQN, 2012\",\"@Type\":\"practice guideline\",\"ID\":{\"$\":\"3234509\",\"@Source\":\"pmc\"}},{\"@Abbrev\":\"Orphanet, 2008\",\"@Type\":\"practice guideline\",\"CitationText\":{\"$\":\"Orphanet Emergency Guidelines: Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI)\"},\"URL\":{\"$\":\"https://www.orpha.net/data/patho/Pro/en/Emergency_OsteogenesisImperfecta.pdf\"}}]}","xrefs":["{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"166200\",\"type\":\"MIM\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"216796\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"666\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"166240\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"OI TYPE IA\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"166200\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"OI, TYPE I\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000260571\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000332445\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000511197\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000521190\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000525779\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000552541\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000561718\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000562498\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Alliance\",\"id\":\"Osteogenesis+imperfecta+type+1/5454\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"SNOMED CT\",\"id\":\"385482004\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"GeneReviews\",\"id\":\"NBK1295\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000323271\",\"ref_field\":\"symbol\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"166200\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"symbol\"}"],"disease_mechanism":"loss of function"}
