{"public_definition":"Mitochondrial complex I deficiency is a shortage (deficiency) of a protein complex called complex I or a loss of its function. Complex I is found in cell structures called mitochondria, which convert the energy from food into a form that cells can use. Complex I is the first of five mitochondrial complexes that carry out a multi-step process called oxidative phosphorylation, through which cells derive much of their energy.Mitochondrial complex I deficiency can cause a wide variety of signs and symptoms affecting many organs and systems of the body, particularly the nervous system, the heart, and the muscles used for movement (skeletal muscles). These signs and symptoms can appear at any time from birth to adulthood.People with mitochondrial complex I deficiency typically have neurological problems, such as abnormal brain function (encephalopathy), recurrent seizures (epilepsy), intellectual disability, difficulty coordinating movements (ataxia), or involuntary movements (dystonia). Affected individuals may have low muscle tone (hypotonia), muscle pain (myalgia), and extreme fatigue in response to physical activity (exercise intolerance). They tend to develop elevated levels of lactic acid in the blood (lactic acidosis), which can cause nausea, vomiting, weakness, and rapid breathing. In severe cases, lactic acidosis can be life-threatening.People with mitochondrial complex I deficiency sometimes have heart, liver, or kidney problems. Vision problems due to abnormal eye movement or breakdown (degeneration) of the nerves that carry signals from the eyes to the brain (optic nerves) can also occur.Some people with mitochondrial complex I deficiency have groups of signs and symptoms that are classified as a specific syndrome. For example, a condition called Leigh syndrome is most commonly caused by mitochondrial complex I deficiency. Leigh syndrome is characterized by progressive loss of mental and movement abilities (developmental or psychomotor regression) and typically results in death within 2 to 3 years from the onset of symptoms. Another condition that can be caused by mitochondrial complex I deficiency, Leber hereditary optic neuropathy, is associated mainly with vision problems due to optic nerve degeneration. These syndromes can also have other causes.","alternate_symbols":[],"keywords":[],"medgen_id":"C1838979","alternate_names":["Complex 1 mitochondrial respiratory chain deficiency","NADH coenzyme Q reductase deficiency"],"id":"3208","attribute_content":[],"xrefs":["{\"db\":\"MONDO\",\"id\":\"MONDO:0009640\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"2609\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Alliance\",\"id\":\"Mitochondrial+complex+I+deficiency/4823\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"mitochondrial-complex-i-deficiency\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}"],"type":"Disease","name":"Mitochondrial complex I deficiency"}
{"public_definition":"ADCY5 dyskinesia is a hyperkinetic movement disorder (more prominent in the face and arms than the legs) characterized by infantile to late-adolescent onset of chorea, athetosis, dystonia, myoclonus, or a combination of these. To date, affected individuals have had overlapping (but not identical) manifestations with wide-ranging severity. The facial movements are typically periorbital and perioral. The dyskinesia is prone to episodic or paroxysmal exacerbation lasting minutes to hours, and may occur during sleep. Precipitating factors in some persons have included emotional stress, intercurrent illness, sneezing, or caffeine; in others, no precipitating factors have been identified. In some children, severe infantile axial hypotonia results in gross motor delays accompanied by chorea, sometimes with language delays. The overall tendency is for the abnormal movements to stabilize in early middle age, at which point they may improve in some individuals; less commonly, the abnormal movements are slowly progressive, increasing in severity and frequency.","alternate_symbols":[],"content":"{\"Citation\":{\"@Abbrev\":\"GeneReviews\",\"@Type\":\"review\",\"ID\":[{\"$\":\"25521004\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"},{\"$\":\"NBK263441\",\"@Source\":\"BookShelf\"}]}}","keywords":[],"symbol":"FDFM","medgen_id":"C1847627","alternate_names":["ADCY5-Related Dyskinesia"],"id":"1994","attribute_content":[],"gard_id":"12722","xrefs":["{\"db\":\"MONDO\",\"id\":\"MONDO:0011707\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"606703\",\"type\":\"MIM\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"324588\"}","{\"db\":\"Office of Rare Diseases\",\"id\":\"12722\",\"ref_field\":\"gard_id\"}","{\"db\":\"GeneReviews\",\"id\":\"NBK263441\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"606703\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"symbol\"}"],"type":"Disease","name":"Dyskinesia, familial, with facial myokymia"}

{"public_definition":"Bardet-Biedl syndrome is a disorder that affects many parts of the body. The signs and symptoms of this condition vary among affected individuals, even among members of the same family.Vision loss is one of the major features of Bardet-Biedl syndrome. Loss of vision occurs as the light-sensing tissue at the back of the eye (the retina) gradually deteriorates. Problems with night vision become apparent by mid-childhood, followed by blind spots that develop in the side (peripheral) vision. Over time, these blind spots enlarge and merge to produce tunnel vision. Most people with Bardet-Biedl syndrome also develop blurred central vision (poor visual acuity) and become legally blind by adolescence or early adulthood.Obesity is another characteristic feature of Bardet-Biedl syndrome. Abnormal weight gain typically begins in early childhood and continues to be an issue throughout life. Complications of obesity can include type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure (hypertension), and abnormally high cholesterol levels (hypercholesterolemia).Other major signs and symptoms of Bardet-Biedl syndrome include the presence of extra fingers or toes (polydactyly), intellectual disability or learning problems, and abnormalities of the genitalia. Most affected males produce reduced amounts of sex hormones (hypogonadism), and they are usually unable to father biological children (infertile). Many people with Bardet-Biedl syndrome also have kidney abnormalities, which can be serious or life-threatening.Additional features of Bardet-Biedl syndrome can include impaired speech, delayed development of motor skills such as standing and walking, behavioral problems such as emotional immaturity and inappropriate outbursts, and clumsiness or poor coordination. Distinctive facial features, dental abnormalities, unusually short or fused fingers or toes, and a partial or complete loss of the sense of smell (anosmia) have also been reported in some people with Bardet-Biedl syndrome. Additionally, this condition can affect the heart, liver, and digestive system.","alternate_symbols":[],"content":"{\"Citation\":[{\"@Abbrev\":\"GeneReviews\",\"@Type\":\"review\",\"ID\":[{\"$\":\"20301537\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"},{\"$\":\"NBK1363\",\"@Source\":\"BookShelf\"}]},{\"@Abbrev\":\"EuroGentest, 2010\",\"@Type\":\"Translational/Evidence-based\",\"ID\":{\"$\":\"3061994\",\"@Source\":\"pmc\"}}]}","keywords":[],"symbol":"BBS","medgen_id":"C0752166","alternate_names":[],"id":"376","attribute_content":[],"gard_id":"6866","xrefs":["{\"db\":\"MONDO\",\"id\":\"MONDO:0015229\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"PS209900\",\"type\":\"Phenotypic series\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"110\"}","{\"db\":\"Office of Rare Diseases\",\"id\":\"6866\",\"ref_field\":\"gard_id\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Alliance\",\"id\":\"Bardet-Biedl+Syndrome/723\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"bardet-biedl-syndrome\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"PS209900\",\"type\":\"Phenotypic series\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"SNOMED CT\",\"id\":\"5619004\",\"ref_field\":\"name\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"bardet-biedl-syndrome\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}"],"type":"Disease","name":"Bardet-Biedl syndrome"}

{"public_definition":"ACTG2-related disorders are a subset of visceral myopathy with variable involvement of the bladder and intestine. Bladder involvement can range from neonatal megacystis and megaureter (with its most extreme form of prune belly syndrome) at the more severe end, to recurrent urinary tract infections and bladder dysfunction at the milder end. Chronic bladder dysfunction carries a high risk for urinary tract infections, dilation of the upper urinary tract, and impaired renal function. Intestinal involvement can range from malrotation, neonatal manifestations of microcolon, megacystic microcolon intestinal hypoperistalsis syndrome (MMIHS), and chronic intestinal pseudoobstruction (CIPO) in neonates, children, and adults. Affected infants (with or without evidence of intestinal malrotation) often present with feeding intolerance and findings of non-mechanical bowel obstruction that persist after successful surgical correction of malrotation. Individuals who develop manifestations of CIPO in later childhood or adulthood often experience episodic waxing and waning of bowel motility. They may undergo frequent abdominal surgeries (perhaps related to malrotation or adhesions causing mechanical obstruction) resulting in resection of dilated segments of bowel, often becoming dependent on total parenteral nutrition (TPN).","alternate_symbols":["ACTG2","MFAP5","MMIHS"],"content":"{\"Citation\":[{\"@Abbrev\":\"GeneReviews\",\"@Type\":\"review\",\"ID\":[{\"$\":\"26072522\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"},{\"$\":\"NBK299311\",\"@Source\":\"BookShelf\"}]},{\"@Abbrev\":\"GeneReviews\",\"@Type\":\"review\",\"ID\":[{\"$\":\"31070878\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"},{\"$\":\"NBK540960\",\"@Source\":\"BookShelf\"}]}]}","keywords":[],"symbol":"VSCM","medgen_id":"C0042781","alternate_names":["Berdon syndrome","Infantile visceral myopathy","Megacystis microcolon intestinal hypoperistalsis syndrome","Megacystis, microcolon, hypoperistalsis syndrome","Megaduodenum and/or megacystis","Pseudoobstruction idiopathic intestinal","Visceral myopathy familial"],"id":"2739","attribute_content":[],"xrefs":["{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"155310\",\"type\":\"MIM\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"2241\"}","{\"db\":\"Orphanet\",\"id\":\"2604\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Alliance\",\"id\":\"Megacystis+microcolon+intestinal+hypoperistalsis+syndrome/4556\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"Megacystis microcolon intestinal hypoperistalsis syndrome\"}","{\"db\":\"Molecular Diagnostics Laboratory,Hospital Sainte-Justine\",\"id\":\"12-068\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"Megacystis, microcolon, hypoperistalsis syndrome\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Alliance\",\"id\":\"Megaduodenum+and-or+megacystis/4557\",\"ref_field\":\"alternate_names\",\"ref_field_element\":\"Megaduodenum and/or megacystis\"}","{\"db\":\"GeneReviews\",\"id\":\"NBK299311\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}","{\"db\":\"OMIM\",\"id\":\"155310\",\"type\":\"MIM\",\"ref_field\":\"symbol\"}"],"type":"Disease","name":"Visceral myopathy"}

{"public_definition":"Breast cancer is a disease in which certain cells in the breast become abnormal and multiply uncontrollably to form a tumor. Although breast cancer is much more common in women, this form of cancer can also develop in men. In both women and men, the most common form of breast cancer begins in cells lining the milk ducts (ductal cancer). In women, cancer can also develop in the glands that produce milk (lobular cancer). Most men have little or no lobular tissue, so lobular cancer in men is very rare.In its early stages, breast cancer usually does not cause pain and may exhibit no noticeable symptoms. As the cancer progresses, signs and symptoms can include a lump or thickening in or near the breast; a change in the size or shape of the breast; nipple discharge, tenderness, or retraction (turning inward); and skin irritation, dimpling, redness, or scaliness. However, these changes can occur as part of many different conditions. Having one or more of these symptoms does not mean that a person definitely has breast cancer.In some cases, cancerous tumors can invade surrounding tissue and spread to other parts of the body. If breast cancer spreads, cancerous cells most often appear in the bones, liver, lungs, or brain. Tumors that begin at one site and then spread to other areas of the body are called metastatic cancers.A small percentage of all breast cancers cluster in families. These cancers are described as hereditary and are associated with inherited gene mutations. Hereditary breast cancers tend to develop earlier in life than noninherited (sporadic) cases, and new (primary) tumors are more likely to develop in both breasts.","alternate_symbols":[],"content":"{\"Citation\":{\"@Abbrev\":\"NSGC, 2013\",\"@Type\":\"practice guideline\",\"ID\":{\"$\":\"23188549\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"}}}","keywords":[],"medgen_id":"C3469522","alternate_names":[],"id":"9673","attribute_content":[],"disease_mechanism":"gain of function","xrefs":["{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000021468\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000210160\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000325401\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000325409\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000326160\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000508956\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000509980\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000509982\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000509983\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000509984\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000509985\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000512528\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000512529\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000512644\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000512645\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000512816\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000520071\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000520394\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000522159\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000522160\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000522161\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000525134\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000552183\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000552245\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000558503\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000570542\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)\",\"id\":\"GTR000591268\",\"ref_field\":\"disease_mechanism\"}","{\"db\":\"Genetics Home Reference\",\"id\":\"breast-cancer\",\"ref_field\":\"public_definition\"}"],"type":"Disease","disease_mechanism_id":"274","name":"Breast cancer, susceptibility to"}

{"public_definition":"Lynch syndrome is characterized by an increased risk for colorectal cancer (CRC) and cancers of the endometrium, stomach, ovary, small bowel, hepatobiliary tract, urinary tract, brain, and skin. In individuals with Lynch syndrome the following lifetime risks for cancer are seen: CRC: 52%-82% (mean age at diagnosis 44-61 years). Endometrial cancer in females: 25%-60% (mean age at diagnosis 48-62 years). Gastric cancer: 6%-13% (mean age at diagnosis 56 years). Ovarian cancer: 4%-12% (mean age at diagnosis 42.5 years; ~30% are diagnosed \u003c age 40 years). The risk for other Lynch syndrome-related cancers is lower, though substantially increased over general population rates.","alternate_symbols":[],"content":"{\"Citation\":[{\"@Abbrev\":\"GeneReviews\",\"@Type\":\"review\",\"ID\":[{\"$\":\"20301390\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"},{\"$\":\"NBK1211\",\"@Source\":\"BookShelf\"}]},{\"@Abbrev\":\"EGAPP,

{"public_definition":"Fabry disease results from deficient activity of the enzyme alpha-galactosidase A (a-Gal A) and progressive lysosomal deposition of globotriaosylceramide (GL-3) in cells throughout the body. The classic form, occurring in males with less than 1% a-Gal A enzyme activity, usually has its onset in childhood or adolescence with periodic crises of severe pain in the extremities (acroparesthesia), the appearance of vascular cutaneous lesions (angiokeratomas), sweating abnormalities (anhidrosis, hypohidrosis, and rarely hyperhidrosis), characteristic corneal and lenticular opacities, and proteinuria. Gradual deterioration of renal function to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) usually occurs in men in the third to fifth decade. In middle age, most males successfully treated for ESRD develop cardiac and/or cerebrovascular disease, a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Heterozygous females typically have milder symptoms at a later age of onset than males. Rarely, they may be relatively asymptomatic throughout a normal life span or may have symptoms as severe as those observed in males with the classic phenotype. In contrast, males with greater than 1% a-Gal A activity may have: (1) a cardiac variant phenotype that usually presents in the sixth to eighth decade with left ventricular hypertrophy, cardiomyopathy and arrhythmia, and proteinuria, but without ESRD; or (2) a renal variant phenotype, associated with ESRD but without the skin lesions or pain; or (3) cerebrovascular disease presenting as stroke or transient ischemic attack.","alternate_symbols":[],"content":"{\"Citation\":[{\"@Type\":\"general\",\"ID\":{\"$\":\"3009617\",\"@Source\":\"pmc\"}},{\"@Abbrev\":\"GeneReviews\",\"@Type\":\"review\",\"ID\":[{\"$\":\"20301469\",\"@Source\":\"PubMed\"},{\"$\":\"NBK1292\",\"@Source\":\"BookShelf\"}]},{\"@Abbrev\":\"HFSA,
