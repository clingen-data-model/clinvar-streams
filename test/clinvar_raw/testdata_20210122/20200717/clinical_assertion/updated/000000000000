The isoleucine residue is weakly conserved and there is a moderate physicochemical difference between isoleucine and lysine. This variant is present in population databases (rs1801155, ExAC 0.3%). This variant is found in ~10% of Ashkenazi Jewish individuals and ~3% of Sephardic Jewish individuals (PMID: 23896379). Other studies have reported a 6-7% frequency in Ashkenazi individuals (PMID: 9288102). This variant is found in ~28% of Ashkenazi Jewish individuals with familial colorectal cancer (PMID: 9288102). ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 822). In a large meta-analysis involving ~10,000 cases and controls (PMID: 23576677), Ashkenazi Jewish individuals who carried the I1307K change had a significantly increased risk of colorectal cancer (OR=2.17, 95% CI=1.65-2.86). By contrast, the I1307K change did not appear to confer any additional risk of colorectal cancer in non-Ashkenazi Jewish individuals (OR=1.36, 95% CI=0.59-3.13). This DNA substitution converts an AAATAAAA sequence element into an extended tract of eight adenosine nucleotides (A8). The A8 mononucleotide tract created by this change has been shown to confer an increased propensity for somatic truncating mutations on this allele (PMID: 9751605). In summary, this is a frequently observed variant that is associated with a 2-fold increased risk of colorectal cancer in the Ashkenazi Jewish population. An increased risk of colorectal cancer in individuals who are not of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry has not been established.\"}"],"interpretation_date_last_evaluated":"2020-01-08","id":"SCV000153895","date_created":"2014-06-03","assertion_type":"variation to disease","submitter_id":"500031","trait_set_id":"6265","internal_id":"279290","review_status":"criteria provided, single submitter","date_last_updated":"2020-07-16","clinical_assertion_observation_ids":["SCV000153895.0"],"rcv_accession_id":"RCV000020088","variation_id":"822","submission_names":["SUB6933842"],"version":"10"}
